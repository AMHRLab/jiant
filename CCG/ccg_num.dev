The Arizona Corporations Commission authorized an 11.5 % rate increase at Tucson Electric Power Co. , substantially lower than recommended last month by a commission hearing officer and barely half the rise sought by the utility .	6 0 0 1 11 6 0 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 29 24 63 40 67 35 38 6 0 0 1 13 62 52 6 1 40 38 6 1 10
The ruling follows a host of problems at Tucson Electric , including major write-downs , a 60 % slash in the common stock dividend and the departure of former Chairman Einar Greve during a company investigation of his stock sales .	6 1 11 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 2 12 0 1 2 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The Arizona regulatory ruling calls for $ 42 million in added revenue yearly , compared with a $ 57 million boost proposed by the commission hearing officer .	6 0 0 1 48 7 86 0 9 12 0 1 78 2 230 7 6 125 0 9 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 10
The company had sought increases totaling $ 80.3 million , or 22 % .	6 1 20 21 1 32 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 10
The decision was announced after trading ended .	6 1 14 40 30 1 34 10

South Korean President Roh Tae Woo , brushing aside suggestions that the won be revalued again , said the currency 's current level against the dollar is appropriate .	36 0 0 0 0 1 2 45 7 485 299 6 1 74 40 35 2 44 6 1 42 0 1 12 6 1 28 24 10
His comments , made in response to reporters ' questions at the National Press Club here , signaled that Seoul is resisting U.S. pressure for a further rise in the currency 's value .	6 1 2 40 38 1 12 1 42 1 38 6 0 0 1 78 2 65 66 1 37 32 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 10
The U.S. wants a higher won to make South Korea 's exports more expensive and help trim Seoul 's trade surplus .	6 1 11 6 0 1 18 178 0 1 42 1 29 24 13 143 19 1 42 0 1 10
Many South Korean business people want a devaluation instead , arguing that the won 's recent gains already have weakened the country 's export performance .	0 36 0 0 1 11 6 1 35 2 207 66 6 1 42 0 1 16 20 21 6 1 42 0 1 10
Mr. Roh also said South Korea is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces .	0 1 16 44 0 1 37 32 1 33 4 134 6 1 18 87 7 0 1 10
Seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won 's value remains heavily controlled .	1 20 773 7 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 7 0 1 6 1 42 1 28 29 24 10
Mr. Roh said a U.S. demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved satisfactorily but gave no hint when that will happen .	0 1 44 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 12 1 4 74 40 35 13 11 6 128 55 23 4 79 10
Speaking to a joint meeting of Congress earlier , he said South Korea ca n't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues without causing political and social trauma .	45 7 6 0 1 12 1 35 2 23 44 0 1 4 35 79 35 38 52 0 0 1 57 32 0 13 0 1 10
Great American Bank said its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank to pursue nontraditional banking activities under a new federal law .	0 0 1 44 6 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 229 6 0 1 18 19 0 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 10
The proposed holding company 's primary purpose would be to allow Great American to continue engaging in real estate development activities , it said .	6 0 0 1 42 0 1 4 154 18 134 0 1 18 168 45 7 0 0 0 1 2 23 27 10
Those activities generated $ 26.1 million in operating profit last year .	6 1 11 86 0 9 12 0 1 67 35 10
But according to Great American , such profits do n't count toward meeting the San Diego savings bank 's new capitalization requirements under 1989 federal law .	76 122 7 0 1 2 52 1 4 35 79 57 32 6 0 0 0 1 42 0 0 1 38 0 0 1 10
The new real estate unit would have a separate capital structure to comply with the law .	6 0 0 0 1 4 19 6 0 0 1 18 87 7 6 1 10
The proposed holding company would also consolidate Great American Bank in San Diego and its Tucson , Ariz. , savings bank into a single , federally chartered institution in San Diego .	6 0 0 1 4 35 5 0 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 36 2 0 2 0 1 7 6 0 2 36 0 1 12 0 1 10
The consolidation is expected to save $ 1 million a year in administrative costs , a Great American spokesman said .	6 1 14 17 18 19 86 0 9 92 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 27 10
Dale Lang , who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of Ms. and Sassy , is candid about the challenge he is taking on .	0 1 2 33 188 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 13 1 2 28 53 7 6 1 23 37 32 35 10
Mr. Lang admits that Ms. is in dire straits and that Sassy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive .	0 1 65 66 1 48 7 0 1 13 66 1 11 0 0 1 18 178 23 24 10
But the 57-year-old publisher has moved quickly and boldly to deal with the magazines ' problems .	76 6 0 1 20 94 35 13 35 18 87 7 6 1 42 1 10
Last Friday , he told the staff of Ms. that the magazine in January would begin publishing without advertising .	137 76 2 23 308 6 1 12 1 66 6 1 85 1 4 168 120 38 1 10
Mr. Lang will do away with expensive circulation drives , not to mention sales staff , and attempt to publish the 17-year-old magazine supported by circulation revenue alone .	0 1 4 87 35 7 0 0 1 2 16 18 19 0 1 2 13 154 18 19 6 0 1 40 38 0 1 78 10
Any fool can publish a money-losing magazine .	6 1 4 19 6 0 1 10
I want to publish one that succeeds , said Mr. Lang .	23 64 18 19 1 33 34 2 56 0 1 10
For Ms. , it 's time to publish for the reader , not the advertiser .	59 1 2 23 11 1 18 79 38 6 1 2 52 6 1 10
As for Sassy , which competes directly with News Corp. 's Seventeen magazine , Mr. Lang says that in the next two years he will spend $ 6 million promoting and improving the magazine .	122 7 1 2 33 48 35 7 0 1 42 0 1 2 0 1 65 66 59 6 0 0 1 23 4 276 86 0 9 32 13 32 6 1 10
Though Sassy has grown quickly since its debut in March 1988 , it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and skittish advertisers who bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen-age problems .	39 1 20 60 35 38 6 1 12 1 123 2 23 20 21 6 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 33 48 7 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
Mr. Lang said the former Australian owners of Sassy were blind-sided by the Moral Majority ... .	0 1 44 6 0 0 1 12 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 106 10
Their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out .	6 1 64 18 19 23 13 19 23 35 10
He said Sassy will keep its irreverent tone , but added , We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine .	23 44 1 4 19 6 0 1 2 13 44 2 23 4 5 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Sassy already has recovered ; circulation has quickly passed the 500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300 .	1 16 20 60 91 1 20 35 21 6 0 1 13 0 1 20 169 81 1 7 24 227 1 10
What 's more , Mr. Lang says he has what all publishers wish for : a bona fide niche .	288 28 24 2 0 1 44 23 11 119 6 1 48 7 12 6 36 0 1 10
Seventeen is written more for mothers , not their daughters , said Mr. Lang .	1 14 40 67 38 1 2 52 6 1 2 56 0 1 10
But Sassy has a different spirit .	76 1 11 6 0 1 10
It gets more mail in a month than McCall 's got in a year , and it 's not from mothers .	23 11 0 1 38 6 1 30 0 1 34 38 6 1 2 13 23 48 35 7 1 10
I feel about Sassy like I did about Working Woman 10 years ago .	23 48 7 1 30 23 48 7 0 1 0 1 26 10
Mr. Lang took on Ms. and Sassy with the acquisition of Matilda Publications Inc. by his newly formed Lang Communications .	0 1 11 35 1 13 1 38 6 1 12 0 0 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 10
Lang owns 70 % of Matilda , while Citicorp owns the rest through its Citicorp Venture Capital Partners .	1 11 0 1 12 1 2 30 1 11 6 1 38 6 0 0 0 1 10
Two weeks ago , Citicorp and Mr. Lang pumped $ 800,000 into Matilda just to keep the doors open .	0 1 234 2 1 13 0 1 11 86 9 38 1 16 18 178 6 1 24 10
Industry observers have congratulated Mr. Lang on what some call his courageous handling of Ms. , but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews .	0 1 20 21 0 1 375 849 23 221 6 0 1 12 1 2 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 158 24 20 21 0 1 10
Besides Ms. and Sassy , closely held Lang Communications includes Success , a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses , and Working Woman and Working Mother , two monthly magazines .	59 1 13 1 2 36 0 0 1 11 1 2 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 2 13 0 1 13 0 1 2 0 0 1 10
Working Woman , with circulation near one million , and Working Mother , with 625,000 circulation , are legitimate magazine success stories .	0 1 2 12 1 12 0 1 2 13 0 1 2 12 0 1 2 11 0 0 0 1 10
The magazine Success , however , was for years lackluster and unfocused .	6 0 1 2 16 2 28 38 1 24 13 24 10
Success is expected to gain at least because of the recent folding of rival Venture , another magazine for growing companies .	1 14 17 18 79 248 148 70 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 10
Working Woman and Working Mother have operated as part of Working Woman\/McCall 's Group , a less-than-successful joint venture between Mr. Lang and Time Warner Inc .	0 1 13 0 1 20 60 38 1 12 0 1 42 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 0 1 10
The joint venture is being undone , with McCall 's magazine being sold last summer to the New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group for about $ 80 million , and Time Warner agreeing to sell back its 50 % interest in Working Woman and Working Mother to Mr. Lang .	6 0 1 37 182 40 2 473 1 42 1 182 231 67 35 7 6 0 0 0 1 42 0 1 7 0 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 113 18 5 35 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 7 0 1 10
Executives at Time Inc . Magazine Co. , a subsidiary of Time Warner , have said the joint venture with Mr. Lang was n't a good one .	1 12 0 0 10 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 2 20 173 6 0 1 12 0 1 11 35 6 0 1 10
The venture , formed in 1986 , was supposed to be Time 's low-cost , safe entry into women 's magazines .	6 1 2 40 38 1 2 14 17 18 19 1 42 0 2 0 1 12 1 42 1 10
Mr. Lang surprised Time soon after joining forces when he said he would negotiate rates individually with advertisers , a practice common in broadcasting but considered taboo by magazine publishers .	0 1 11 1 67 57 32 1 30 23 44 23 4 19 1 35 38 1 2 6 1 53 7 1 13 15 1 38 0 1 10
In addition , McCall 's put in a less than stellar performance .	59 1 2 0 1 11 35 6 36 36 0 1 10
Until a recent comeback , it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation .	59 6 0 1 2 23 11 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 10
Time executives complained about the shoddy editorial quality , and in the end , one Time executive who asked not to be identified said , Frankly , McCall 's and the joint venture were an embarrassment .	0 1 48 7 6 0 0 1 2 13 59 6 1 2 0 0 1 33 64 16 18 74 40 44 2 76 2 0 1 13 6 0 1 11 6 1 10
Mr. Lang feels that Time 's priorities changed .	0 1 65 66 1 42 1 34 10
Their management changed right after -LCB- the venture was formed -RCB- , and I do n't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women 's service magazines .	6 1 34 67 35 117 6 1 14 40 167 2 13 23 4 35 215 23 28 24 120 38 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
Today , Mr. Lang believes his magazines will offer what many women 's magazines do n't .	76 2 0 1 44 6 1 4 19 119 0 1 42 1 11 35 10
We write straight for women on their level , he said .	23 34 35 38 1 38 6 1 2 23 27 10
We do n't have passive readers .	23 4 35 19 0 1 10
Mr. Lang points out that even Success , in part , fits the company 's image , since about 30 % of its readership is female .	0 1 65 35 66 0 1 2 85 1 2 11 6 1 42 1 2 30 36 0 1 12 6 1 28 24 10
Mr. Lang has named Carol Taber , 43 , as group publisher of New York-based Lang Communications .	0 1 20 139 0 1 2 1 2 7 0 1 12 36 0 0 1 10
She will oversee Working Woman , Working Mother and Success magazines , and retain her post as publisher of Working Woman .	23 4 19 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 2 13 19 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 10
The sale price of McCall 's -- twice what Mr. Lang originally paid for it -- will finance Lang Communications ' buy-back of Time Warner 's 50 % interest in Working Woman and Working Mother .	6 0 1 12 0 1 106 69 138 0 1 16 11 38 23 106 4 19 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 42 36 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 10
Mr. Lang says he is n't scouting new acquisitions , at least for now .	0 1 44 23 37 35 32 0 1 2 248 148 38 1 10
We would have to go outside to banks to get the money and I am not ready to do that , he said .	23 4 154 18 115 24 38 1 18 19 6 1 13 23 28 35 43 18 19 23 2 23 27 10

Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission Wednesday cleared Rhone-Poulenc S.A. 's purchase of a specialty bulk-chemical unit from Monsanto Co. , saying the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on U.K. industrial consumers .	1 42 1 13 0 1 16 11 0 1 42 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 214 6 1 28 43 18 19 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
The commission , which was asked to study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February , said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant U.K. market share Rhone-Poulenc would gain through the acquisition .	6 1 2 33 14 17 18 19 6 1 38 6 1 12 1 13 1 38 6 1 12 1 2 44 6 1 12 0 1 12 1 40 57 32 0 1 28 43 171 18 19 6 0 0 0 1 1 4 19 38 6 1 10

The commission found that if the British government attempted to block the merger , Rhone-Poulenc would likely respond by closing the salicylates plant Monsanto operates in Wales , removing the matter from U.K. jurisdiction .	6 1 65 66 39 6 0 1 64 18 19 6 1 2 1 4 35 79 57 32 6 0 1 1 11 12 1 2 32 6 1 38 0 1 10

The decline primarily reflected the dilution from acquiring McCall 's , Golf World -LRB- U.S. -RRB- and Sailing World magazines ; lower equity earnings from the forest-products group because of price discounting and an unfavorable exchange rate , and an 8.7 % decline in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship newspaper .	6 1 16 11 6 1 93 32 0 1 2 0 1 12 1 167 13 0 0 1 91 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 230 7 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 2 13 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 1 10

Could the collapse of I-880 have been prevented ?	244 6 1 12 1 163 151 40 10
That was the question structural engineers and California transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that caved in during Tuesday 's temblor .	23 11 6 1 0 1 13 0 0 1 37 146 23 35 30 0 1 11 6 0 1 93 113 18 19 366 24 7 0 1 70 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 33 34 35 38 1 42 1 10
After touring the area , California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway 's collapse , blaming the disaster on substandard construction , the Associated Press reported .	181 32 6 1 2 0 0 0 1 72 16 48 7 6 1 12 6 1 42 1 2 111 6 1 7 0 1 2 6 0 1 27 10
The impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives .	6 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 14 16 22 7 0 1 10
But there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of California 's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor .	76 50 51 0 0 1 33 11 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 42 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened , and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $ 250 million , said Charles J. O'Connell , deputy district director in Los Angeles of the California Department of Transportation , nicknamed Caltrans .	192 283 35 661 0 1 346 6 0 1 33 4 5 1 7 0 1 14 40 2 13 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 4 79 38 24 227 86 0 9 2 56 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 15 1 10
Caltrans in Sacramento said total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around $ 500 million .	1 12 1 44 0 1 12 6 0 1 14 22 7 0 86 0 9 10
The aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in Los Angeles as well , as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring double-decking to Los Angeles freeways by 1994 .	6 1 12 6 0 1 37 120 38 0 1 67 35 2 30 0 1 34 35 38 1 18 19 1 38 0 0 1 38 1 10
Caltrans plans to add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a 2.5-mile stretch of the Harbor Freeway just south of Los Angeles , near the Memorial Coliseum .	1 64 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 13 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 69 230 7 0 1 2 12 6 0 1 10
Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn yesterday vowed to fight the introduction of double-decking in the area .	0 0 0 0 0 1 16 64 18 19 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 10
Caltrans abandoned double-decking in the early 1970s , following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of Los Angeles , Mr. O'Connell explained .	1 11 1 38 6 0 1 2 38 6 0 0 1 33 11 0 1 69 230 7 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
That temblor measured 6.1 on the Richter scale ; Tuesday 's was	6 1 11 1 38 6 0 1 91 76 922 185
So why even consider stacking freeways now ?	76 712 16 168 32 1 35 10
We 've run out of places to build freeways in L.A. , and the only place to go is up , Mr. O'Connell said , although he acknowledges there are many obstacles , including cost .	23 20 169 35 7 1 18 19 1 12 1 2 13 6 0 1 18 79 28 24 2 0 1 27 2 104 23 44 50 51 0 1 2 12 1 10
But as for safety , he says double-deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale .	76 122 7 1 2 23 44 0 1 40 35 38 6 36 0 1 13 0 1 40 38 6 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday .	1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 28 24 35 10
But most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks , and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable , or liquefy , in a major quake .	76 0 0 1 11 6 1 38 0 1 12 6 1 33 11 6 1 2 13 6 80 66 6 1 12 6 1 11 35 1 13 4 115 24 2 13 79 2 38 6 0 1 10
The two-story roadway , designed in the mid-1940s and completed in 1957 , was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in highways today .	6 0 1 2 40 38 6 1 13 40 38 1 2 14 40 38 1 33 16 11 6 1 12 0 1 40 38 1 35 10
While the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement , they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal ties that run horizontally through the column , said Leo Parker , a structural engineer in Los Angeles .	39 6 1 4 19 0 0 1 120 35 38 23 38 1 2 23 16 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 33 34 35 38 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes , with spiraling steel rods inside .	1 16 11 6 1 12 6 1 0 1 11 2 12 0 0 1 78 10
But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway , the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck , crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below .	76 59 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 52 1 82 6 1 12 6 1 18 79 13 79 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 32 1 33 14 40 35 38 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 36 0 1 26 10
Officials of the state agency did n't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did n't hold up .	1 12 6 0 1 4 35 19 6 0 128 55 6 1 4 35 79 35 10
Caltrans reinforced the highway in 1977 as part of a $ 55 million statewide project , using steel cables to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from swaying in a quake .	1 11 6 1 38 1 38 1 12 6 125 0 9 0 1 2 229 0 1 18 5 6 1 12 6 1 7 6 1 13 5 6 1 155 120 38 6 1 10
Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago in Sacramento declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work .	0 0 0 1 85 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 33 11 6 0 1 10
Liability in the bridge and road collapses will revolve around whether government took reasonable care to build and maintain the structures , says John Messina , a Tacoma , Wash. , personal-injury attorney who specializes in highway design and maintenance cases .	1 12 6 0 13 0 1 4 87 309 55 1 11 0 1 18 19 13 19 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 36 2 0 2 0 1 33 48 7 0 0 13 0 1 10
The firm brought in to strengthen the structure could be liable as well .	6 1 40 35 18 19 6 1 4 115 24 67 35 10
The results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken , Mr. Messina says .	6 1 12 6 1 16 11 1 54 55 0 1 14 40 2 0 1 27 10
Given the seismic history of the Bay Area , it seems to me that a 6.9 earthquake is a foreseeable event .	59 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 23 65 38 23 66 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 10
Caltrans ' Mr. Drago defended the agency 's work on the Nimitz Freeway .	1 42 0 1 11 6 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 10
The work was done properly , he said .	6 1 14 40 35 2 23 27 10
Basically , we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something the structure could n't withstand .	76 2 23 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 23 11 35 23 6 1 4 35 19 10
Ironically , Caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state , this time wrapping freeway columns in steel blankets to reinforce them .	76 2 1 188 1 37 45 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 2 188 1 111 0 1 7 0 1 18 19 23 10
But only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority , and the Nimitz Freeway , supported by double rows , was left out , Mr. Drago explained .	76 0 1 22 7 0 1 12 1 11 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 2 40 38 0 1 2 14 40 35 2 0 1 27 10
The reason is that the technology is such that we 're not able to retrofit multi-column structures , he said .	6 1 65 66 6 1 28 266 66 23 28 35 43 18 19 0 1 2 23 27 10

Lionel Corp. 's board unanimously rejected a tender offer of $ 8 a share , or $ 95.4 million , for as much as 90 % of Lionel by a group with a 9.9 % stake in the toy retailer .	0 1 42 1 16 11 6 0 1 12 86 9 92 1 2 13 86 0 9 2 12 366 24 7 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Lionel also urged holders of its stock and debt not to tender their securities , saying it wants to remain independent to pursue its business strategy .	1 16 82 1 12 6 1 13 1 16 18 19 6 1 2 214 23 64 18 115 24 18 19 6 0 1 10
Lionel also said the offer by Robert I. Toussie Limited Partnership is inadequate , and full of conditions that leave it subject to substantial uncertainty .	1 16 44 6 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 28 24 2 13 53 7 1 238 178 23 53 7 0 1 10
In addition , Lionel began a lawsuit in federal District Court in New York seeking to enjoin the offer , alleging , among other things , violations of federal securities law and fraudulent manipulation of the market for Lionel 's securities .	59 1 2 1 11 6 1 38 0 0 1 12 0 1 113 18 19 6 1 2 120 2 38 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 13 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 42 1 10
Robert I. Toussie , general partner of the investment group , said the Lionel response reflected management 's entrenched position , saying officials had failed to come up with a better alternative to his group 's offer .	0 0 1 2 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 44 6 0 1 11 1 42 0 1 2 214 1 20 94 18 87 35 7 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 10

Efforts by a federal mediator to reignite talks between Boeing Co. and the Machinists union apparently failed , and no further meetings are scheduled .	1 12 6 0 1 18 19 1 12 0 1 13 6 0 1 16 34 2 13 6 0 1 14 40 10
Company officials and union representatives did n't meet face to face , but the mediator shuttled between the two groups .	0 1 13 0 1 4 35 79 67 67 35 2 13 6 1 34 38 6 0 1 10
In a statement issued after the meeting , the aerospace giant said it wo n't increase its offer although adjustments within the proposed pay-and-benefit mix are possible .	59 6 1 40 38 6 1 2 6 0 1 44 23 4 35 19 6 1 30 1 12 6 0 0 1 28 24 10
Machinists already have rejected a proposal that called for a 4 % pay increase and 8 % bonus in the first year .	1 16 20 21 6 1 33 48 7 6 36 0 0 1 13 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
In the second year , workers would receive a 3 % wage boost and a 3 % bonus , followed by a 3 % increase without a bonus in the third year .	59 6 0 1 2 1 4 19 6 36 0 0 1 13 6 36 0 1 2 230 7 6 36 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
The company will not budge on anything , said a spokesman for the union .	6 1 4 35 79 38 23 2 56 6 1 12 6 1 10
As the strike enters its 15th day today , some members are getting nervous , the spokesman conceded , but the majority of the 55,000 Machinists are prepared to wait it out as long as it takes .	39 6 1 11 6 0 1 35 2 6 1 37 156 24 2 6 1 27 2 13 6 1 12 6 0 1 14 17 18 19 23 35 67 35 117 23 34 10

Coupled with his current 1.2 million shares and 4 % held by an associate , the stake would have given him control of 55 % of the concern .	122 7 6 0 36 0 1 13 0 1 40 38 6 1 2 6 1 4 163 114 23 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 10
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Ruskin had said that holders of the other 45 % of United Merchants would receive one-half share of a new preferred stock for each of their shares .	59 6 0 13 0 0 1 2 0 1 20 174 66 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 4 19 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 23 12 6 1 10
A special committee of United Merchants directors said that in view of uncertainties regarding various legal and financial considerations , it could n't recommend the plan to the full board .	6 0 1 12 0 0 1 65 66 59 1 12 1 12 0 0 13 0 1 2 23 4 35 5 6 1 7 6 0 1 10

In a separate SEC filing , Albert Safer , who holds 6.46 % of United Merchants , said he retained investment bank Lazard Freres & Co. for advice as he evaluates the possibility of making a bid for the textile maker .	59 6 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 33 11 0 1 12 0 1 2 44 23 11 0 0 0 0 0 1 38 1 30 23 11 6 1 93 32 6 1 12 6 0 1 10

The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly .	6 0 1 37 156 285 23 4 5 23 155 32 6 1 35 10
In the aftermath of the California earthquake , President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning .	59 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 0 1 13 6 1 34 38 6 1 12 0 1 67 35 10
Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims , but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action .	23 12 23 28 43 18 276 0 1 120 38 1 2 13 23 14 17 35 18 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
Mr. Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast , and they clearly do n't want a repeat of those charges now .	0 1 13 6 1 14 22 155 120 67 35 30 6 0 0 0 1 28 24 38 0 1 13 0 1 11 6 0 1 2 13 23 16 4 35 19 6 1 12 6 1 35 10

By noon , Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle , who was in California ; made a televised statement of concern ; signed a disaster proclamation ; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ; and visited FEMA headquarters .	59 1 2 0 1 20 21 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 33 48 7 1 91 21 6 0 1 12 1 91 21 6 0 1 91 21 6 0 1 38 6 0 0 0 1 91 13 21 0 1 10

On his FEMA visit , Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be less carping about the emergency office 's performance this time , adding that the agency took a hit for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo .	59 6 0 1 2 0 1 65 66 23 44 50 190 19 0 1 12 6 0 1 42 1 81 1 2 207 66 6 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 10

Beazer PLC , a major British building materials and construction concern , reported a 24 % jump in pretax profit for its latest financial year , helped largely by contributions from its U.S. unit , Koppers Co .	0 1 2 6 0 0 0 0 13 0 1 2 11 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 40 67 38 1 12 6 0 1 2 0 1 10
Pretax profit for the year to June 30 rose to # 142.5 million -LRB- $ 224.5 million -RRB- from # 114.7 million -LRB- $ 180.7 million -RRB- , broadly matching analysts ' expectations .	0 1 12 6 1 12 86 9 34 38 86 0 9 12 86 0 9 167 38 86 0 9 12 86 0 9 167 2 16 32 1 42 1 10

The lethal shudders that wracked the San Francisco Bay Area -- rated a 6.9 on the Richter scale -- did n't match the great earthquake of 1906 , rated at 8.25 .	6 0 1 33 11 6 0 0 0 1 106 15 6 1 12 6 0 1 106 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 1 2 22 7 1 10
The difference of just 1.35 points on the scale , designed by Charles Richter of CalTech in the 1930s , means the older quake was 10 to 20 times stronger , says Lane Johnson , director of the University of California Berkeley Seismographic Station .	6 1 12 36 0 1 12 6 1 2 40 38 0 1 12 1 38 6 1 2 44 6 0 1 28 29 573 116 29 24 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 71 1 210 0 1 10
The ground ruptured along a 20-to-30-mile stretch of the San Andreas Fault on Tuesday , Mr. Johnson added .	6 1 34 38 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 38 1 2 0 1 27 10
In 1906 , the rupture was 300 miles long and a couple feet wide .	59 1 2 6 1 28 0 1 3 13 6 0 1 3 10
Though the epicenter of Tuesday 's temblor was located 10 miles north of the town of Santa Cruz , and 50 miles south of San Francisco , its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion .	39 6 1 12 1 42 1 14 152 0 1 699 7 6 1 12 0 1 2 13 0 1 699 7 0 1 2 6 1 34 38 6 1 38 36 0 1 10
But the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways perched upon landfill , as were the Marina District of San Francisco and the Bay Bridge -- two areas of maximum devastation .	76 6 0 1 14 22 7 1 13 1 40 38 1 2 297 206 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 10
Landfill -- loose and unconsolidated earth -- may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when you shake it , said Douglas Segar , professor of geosciences at San Francisco State University in a televised interview .	1 12 0 13 0 1 106 4 87 7 1 13 23 34 38 1 30 23 11 23 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 1 12 0 0 0 1 153 6 0 1 10
It liquefies in a patchwork quilt pattern .	23 34 38 6 0 0 1 10
Our quake behaved much like the Mexico City earthquake , where great damage was miles from the epicenter .	6 1 34 67 38 6 0 0 1 2 75 0 1 48 1 372 6 1 10
Mr. Johnson , of the Berkeley seismographic station , said : Landfill can be done if it 's properly compacted .	0 1 2 12 6 0 0 1 2 44 106 1 4 74 40 30 23 14 16 40 10
You can drive piles on it and build on it .	23 4 19 1 38 23 13 79 38 23 10
He cited the example of San Francisco 's financial district , where many new glass towers survived almost unscathed .	23 11 6 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 2 75 0 0 0 1 28 29 24 10
But the public policy issues raised by earthquake damage will be difficult to address , Mr. Johnson predicted .	76 6 0 0 1 40 38 0 1 4 115 127 18 19 2 0 1 27 10
The attention span of the public is short , he said .	6 0 1 12 6 1 28 24 2 23 27 10
We 've known for years and years we 've got lots of old -LCB- pre-1950s -RCB- unreinforced brick and masonry buildings .	23 20 173 38 1 13 1 23 20 21 1 12 0 662 24 167 0 0 13 0 1 10
One old building , the Golden State Bank Building on Front Street , had its yellow brick facade sheared off by the shock of the quake , leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air , while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing rush-hour pedestrians and cars .	0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 175 6 0 0 1 40 35 38 6 1 12 6 1 2 327 6 1 12 6 0 1 53 7 6 1 2 30 1 12 0 1 34 38 6 1 123 16 32 0 1 13 1 10
Reinforcing such old building stock , Mr. Johnson said , comes down to money .	32 52 0 0 1 2 0 1 44 2 239 24 7 1 10
It 's a danger .	23 11 6 1 10
We know it 's there .	23 44 23 28 24 10
And sooner or later , we have to do something about it .	76 76 13 76 2 23 64 18 19 23 38 23 10
The urgency is heightened because this week 's earthquake -- while major and followed by hundreds of aftershocks -- did n't release enough pent-up energy tension along the faultlines to preclude more and bigger quakes soon .	6 1 14 40 30 6 1 42 1 106 251 24 13 40 38 1 12 1 106 4 35 19 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 18 19 0 13 0 1 78 10

After the confusion surrounding the change of the Coke formula in 1985 , Coca-Cola was reluctant to clutter the Classic name with a brand extension .	59 6 1 32 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 1 28 43 18 19 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
But now , the soft-drink giant appears willing to take the risk .	76 76 2 6 0 1 28 43 18 19 6 1 10
The name Classic Coke has tremendous value , and they have n't merchandised that name before , says Jesse Meyers , publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest .	6 0 0 1 11 0 1 2 13 23 20 35 21 6 1 35 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10

But that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether Dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $ 3.44 a share , or $ 635 million .	76 6 1 12 0 1 11 1 375 55 1 4 87 7 6 0 0 1 12 86 9 92 1 2 13 86 0 9 10
Dow would earn $ 14.85 a share for the year if it equaled that year-ago fourth-quarter performance .	1 4 19 86 9 92 1 38 6 1 30 23 11 6 0 0 1 10
Dow officials were signaling that the company would earn less than $ 15 a share this year even before they announced in July a plan to acquire 67 % of Marion Laboratories Inc .	0 1 37 207 66 6 1 4 19 24 227 86 9 92 1 81 1 67 30 23 11 38 1 6 1 18 19 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
That acquisition could further dilute earnings per share this year , the company spokeswoman said .	6 1 4 16 19 1 12 1 81 1 2 6 0 1 27 10
Dow has n't said exactly what impact the Marion acquisition will have on 1989 earnings .	1 20 35 318 76 376 1 6 0 1 4 5 7 0 1 10
Dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors , including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals , a slower U.S. economy and a stronger dollar , which made Dow 's exports from the U.S. more expensive to overseas customers .	1 73 6 0 0 1 7 0 1 2 12 0 1 12 1 13 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 2 33 136 1 42 1 12 6 1 29 53 7 0 1 10
Another problem was a 7 % increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only 2 % .	6 1 11 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 75 1 37 120 38 36 0 1 10
For the first nine months of the year , Dow earned $ 2.06 billion , or $ 11.41 a share , up 17 % from $ 1.76 billion , or $ 9.32 a share , a year ago .	59 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 2 1 11 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 2 180 0 1 7 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 2 6 1 89 10
Sales for the latest nine months rose 7.7 % to $ 13.34 billion from $ 12.38 billion in the year-ago period .	1 12 6 0 0 1 34 67 35 38 86 0 9 38 86 0 9 68 6 0 1 10
Whether or not great cases make bad-law -- as Justice Holmes asserted -- who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the nominee 's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history ?	39 13 105 0 1 11 1 106 30 0 1 34 106 246 4 77 66 39 0 0 1 48 7 6 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 23 11 0 0 1 10
Ethan Bronner 's Battle for Justice : How the Bork Nomination Shook America -LRB- Norton , 399 pages , $ 22.50 -RRB- is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings , done with journalistic verve , but with a flawed legal philosophy .	0 1 42 1 217 1 106 939 6 0 1 11 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 86 9 167 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 40 38 0 1 2 13 38 6 0 0 1 10
While the book amply justifies its subtitle , the title itself is dubious .	39 6 1 16 11 6 1 2 6 1 78 28 24 10
What shook America was not a battle for justice but for naked power , in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had demonized .	118 11 1 11 35 6 1 12 1 13 12 0 1 2 12 124 6 1 12 0 1 436 24 6 1 23 20 21 10
In its basic structure and style the book is novelistic , with piquant character portrayal , hard-wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely to be encountered in a Washington docudrama than in a constitutional history .	59 6 0 1 13 1 6 1 28 24 2 38 0 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 12 6 1 29 43 18 74 40 38 6 0 1 213 7 6 0 1 10
Mr. Bronner seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way .	0 1 64 18 77 66 6 1 4 163 60 81 1 10
I doubt that .	23 11 23 10
Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments , the contingency plans in place , and Mr. Bork 's paper trail of vulnerable writings , it was pretty clear that Judge Bork never stood much chance of being confirmed .	59 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 2 13 0 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 2 192 383 29 24 66 0 1 16 11 0 1 93 182 40 10
As Mr. Bronner himself says , the smell of raw meat was in the air .	39 0 1 78 34 2 6 1 12 0 1 48 7 6 1 10
Perhaps because they won , Mr. Bork 's attackers come through more vividly than his defenders .	137 39 23 34 2 0 1 42 1 34 35 67 35 68 6 1 10
Ralph Neas was the organizing genius , whipping a conglomerate of pressure groups into an irresistible attacking force .	0 1 11 6 0 1 2 111 6 1 12 0 1 7 6 0 0 1 10
Harvard 's Laurence Tribe was the constitutional heavy , laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow .	1 42 0 1 11 6 0 1 2 32 35 0 1 710 6 1 13 1 18 19 10
But it was Ted Kennedy who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of Robert Bork 's America -- the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically , he claimed , from the positions Mr. Bork had taken over the space of two decades .	76 192 233 0 1 33 34 67 35 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 42 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 33 4 79 35 2 23 44 2 38 6 1 0 1 20 21 38 6 1 12 0 1 10
Sen. Kennedy , never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground , emoted brilliantly .	0 1 2 16 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 34 35 10
I add two others .	23 11 0 1 10
Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed at showing that Mr. Bork was willing to stretch the Constitution in one area -LRB- free speech -RRB- while remaining rigid in all the others .	0 0 0 1 12 1 73 6 1 7 6 0 1 22 155 207 66 0 1 28 43 18 19 6 1 38 0 1 12 0 1 167 57 156 24 38 52 6 1 10
It achieved a good media play , and enabled Sen. Specter and others to vote against Mr. Bork out of conscience .	23 11 6 0 0 1 2 13 82 0 1 13 1 18 87 7 0 1 70 7 1 10
Further ammunition came from left legal theorist Ronald Dworkin , who in the New York Review of Books painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the Constitution , particularly in the area of original intent .	0 1 34 38 0 0 0 0 1 2 33 85 6 0 0 1 12 1 11 6 1 237 6 0 1 16 111 6 0 1 7 6 1 2 67 38 6 1 12 0 1 10
The charge of being outside the mainstream of legal thought gravely undercut Mr. Bork 's scholarly standing , leaving him bleeding on the platform .	6 1 93 45 7 6 1 12 0 1 16 11 0 1 42 0 1 2 252 23 120 38 6 1 10
The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of Democratic moderates in the South and Southwest had broken party lines .	6 1 16 4 163 151 40 30 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 13 1 20 21 0 1 10
But Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin to punish them in their next Senate elections .	76 0 0 0 1 12 1 308 6 0 1 66 0 1 13 1 4 19 6 1 18 19 23 38 6 0 0 1 10
Demographics converged with mainstream and demonizing to seal Robert Bork 's fate .	1 479 7 1 13 1 18 19 0 1 42 1 10
The upshot ?	6 1 10
Mr. Bork 's opponents chose the battlefield , held it and kept it .	0 1 42 1 11 6 1 2 11 23 13 11 23 10
Yet with the smooth confirmation of Anthony Kennedy , an 80 percenter only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. Bork , the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war .	76 59 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 116 116 29 53 7 0 1 84 0 1 2 6 1 4 163 21 6 1 13 21 6 1 10
Another upshot , however , was the chilling message the Bork hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the Supreme Court draws its talent .	6 1 2 16 2 11 6 0 1 6 0 1 11 38 6 0 1 12 124 6 0 1 11 6 1 10
The word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey , with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen .	6 1 34 35 38 6 0 1 30 23 12 0 0 1 4 19 6 0 0 1 2 38 6 0 1 13 6 1 12 6 1 13 1 10
Unfortunately , the author simply does n't supply the philosophical frame to sustain his reportorial talents .	76 2 6 1 16 4 35 19 6 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
He has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture .	23 20 72 16 21 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
Probing more deeply into the doctrine of judicial restraint , he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of Justice Holmes .	120 67 35 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 23 4 163 21 6 0 1 120 70 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
He would discover it also in Alexander Bickel , a subtle constitutional scholar , Mr. Bork 's closest friend at Yale , whose influence on the judge goes well beyond Mr. Bronner 's reporting .	23 4 19 23 35 38 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 12 1 2 135 1 217 6 1 34 67 38 0 1 42 1 10
Still , the long view of Robert Bork as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one .	76 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 10
His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine , which keeps the Court clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives .	6 1 34 38 6 0 1 2 33 136 6 1 53 7 0 0 1 13 73 0 1 12 6 1 7 0 1 13 1 10
Unfortunately , Mr. Bork failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere .	76 2 0 1 64 18 87 7 52 1 13 6 1 12 0 1 53 7 6 1 33 4 74 40 35 30 23 64 18 79 10
The question of segregated schools , in Brown vs. Board of Education , was such an issue .	6 1 12 0 1 2 12 1 12 1 12 1 2 11 52 6 1 10
In our time abortion has become another , best left to a line of Supreme Court decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures .	59 6 1 1 20 21 23 2 16 22 224 6 1 12 0 0 1 161 161 7 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
A reflective and growing consensus of Americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters -LRB- decided in the Griswold case -RRB- to abortion as well .	6 0 13 0 1 12 1 16 64 18 5 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 196 40 38 6 0 1 167 7 1 67 35 10
One can understand Mr. Bork 's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched , though a Supreme Court composed of men and women with realism , guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it .	23 4 19 0 1 42 80 66 6 0 1 12 1 4 74 16 40 2 30 6 0 1 22 7 1 13 1 12 1 2 1 13 6 1 12 1 4 115 43 18 19 23 10
What is certain is that if Americans allow another happening like the degrading Bork confirmation circus , it will be at their peril .	118 28 24 65 66 39 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 23 4 87 7 6 1 10

Sotheby 's Inc. , the world 's biggest auction house , is taking a huge Wall Street-style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell Soup Co. heir .	1 42 1 2 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 37 32 6 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 10
The Financial Services division has guaranteed the Dorrance family that it will receive a minimum of $ 100 million for the collection , regardless of what the bids for the art works total , people close to the transaction say .	6 0 0 1 20 300 6 0 1 66 23 4 19 6 1 12 86 0 9 38 6 1 2 70 7 119 6 1 12 6 0 1 11 2 1 24 84 6 1 27 10

What Sotheby 's is doing closely resembles an underwriting by an investment bank .	119 0 1 37 32 16 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
A corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a Wall Street firm , which purchases the securities outright , accepting the financial risk of finding buyers .	6 1 33 64 18 19 1 13 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 2 33 11 6 1 35 2 32 6 0 1 93 32 1 10
If the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issuer , it makes a profit .	39 6 0 1 4 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 75 23 11 6 1 2 23 11 6 1 10
At the initial sale last night , for example -- the sale featuring the Impressionists masters -- bids totaled $ 116 million .	59 6 0 1 69 78 2 12 1 12 6 1 32 6 0 1 106 1 11 86 0 9 10
That was slightly above Sotheby 's presale estimate of $ 111 million .	23 48 161 7 1 42 0 1 12 86 0 9 10
Normally , Sotheby 's would have earned 20 % of the total in commissions .	76 2 0 1 4 163 21 0 1 12 6 1 38 1 10
Instead , people familiar with the transaction said , the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $ 100 million .	76 2 1 24 84 6 1 44 2 6 0 1 643 18 19 6 1 1091 1 18 19 6 1 13 7 1 93 32 6 0 1 12 1 32 86 0 9 10
Art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price , a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented .	0 1 65 66 39 0 1 16 108 6 1 12 6 36 0 1 12 1 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 28 24 10
Diana D. Brooks , president of Sotheby 's North America division , vehemently denies it offered the Dorrance heirs a money-back guarantee , calling such reports inaccurate .	0 0 1 2 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 2 16 44 23 108 6 0 1 6 0 1 2 327 52 1 24 10
Buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale , however , appears the statement , Sotheby 's has an interest in the property in this catalog .	40 38 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 2 76 2 242 6 1 2 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 10
Explains a Sotheby 's spokeswoman , the statement means exactly what it says .	271 6 1 42 1 2 6 1 11 52 119 23 11 10

Sotheby 's made the $ 100 million guarantee to keep the Dorrance collection away from its archrival , auction house Christie 's International PLC ; Christie 's has handled smaller sales for the Dorrance family over the years .	0 1 11 6 125 0 9 1 18 178 6 0 1 53 7 6 1 2 52 52 0 1 78 78 91 0 1 20 21 0 1 38 6 0 1 38 6 1 10
When Christie 's officials asked why the firm was n't picked to sell the Dorrance collection , representatives of the Dorrance family told us it was a question of financial considerations , said Michael Findlay , Christie 's head of impressionist and modern paintings .	39 1 42 1 162 55 6 1 14 35 17 18 19 6 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 277 23 23 11 6 1 12 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 42 1 12 0 13 0 1 10
Collectors who have made their money on Wall Street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom , but recently it appears Sotheby 's has been returning the compliment .	1 33 20 21 6 1 38 0 1 20 21 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 1 20 328 19 6 0 1 2 13 76 23 44 0 1 20 121 32 6 1 10
In November 1987 , Sotheby 's essentially offered a Wall Street-style bridge loan of about $ 27 million to Australian businessman Alan Bond to enable him to purchase Vincent van Gogh 's Irises for $ 53.9 million .	59 1 123 2 0 1 16 73 6 36 0 0 1 12 0 86 0 9 7 0 0 0 1 18 134 23 18 5 0 0 1 42 1 7 86 0 9 10
It was the highest bid in history for a work of art .	23 11 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 1 10
But two weeks ago , Sotheby 's said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid .	76 0 1 234 2 0 1 65 66 23 11 6 1 38 1 13 1 30 6 1 20 35 151 16 40 10
Sotheby 's is offering such deals because it 's an art sellers ' market , at least where the best works are concerned , says Ralph Lerner , an attorney and author of the book Art Law .	0 1 37 32 52 1 30 23 11 6 0 1 42 1 2 248 148 30 6 0 1 14 40 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 13 1 12 6 1 69 78 10
There seems to be a lot of art for sale , but there 's more competition .	50 301 18 5 6 1 12 1 7 1 2 13 50 51 0 1 10
The competition gives the seller the ability to cut a better deal , he says .	6 1 108 6 1 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 2 23 27 10
The Dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $ 100 million , people familiar with the transaction said .	6 0 1 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 2 1 24 84 6 1 27 10
But it 's likely that Sotheby 's will take a higher than usual commission , called an override , on the amount exceeding the guarantee .	76 192 383 24 66 0 1 4 19 6 0 71 1 1 2 15 6 1 2 38 6 1 32 6 1 10
Sotheby 's has been aggressively promoting the Dorrance sale .	0 1 20 121 16 32 6 0 1 10
At a news conference last May announcing plans for the auction , Sotheby 's estimated its value in excess of $ 100 million .	59 6 0 1 69 78 32 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 73 6 1 7 1 12 86 0 9 10
More recently , Sotheby 's has predicted the collection will fetch $ 140 million .	137 76 2 0 1 20 173 6 1 4 19 86 0 9 10
That 's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history .	23 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
The decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many , since Mr. Dorrance had served as chairman of the Philadelphia Museum of Art , and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the institution .	6 1 18 5 6 0 1 7 6 1 11 1 2 30 0 1 20 169 7 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 13 192 617 151 330 1 12 6 1 4 74 22 7 6 1 10
At last night 's sale , 13 of 44 works that sold were purchased by Aska International Gallery , the art-acquisition unit of Aichi Financial , a Japanese conglomerate that owns 7.5 % of Christie 's .	59 0 1 42 1 2 1 217 0 1 33 34 14 40 38 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 33 11 0 1 12 0 1 10

The consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a disinterested middleman , says New York art dealer David Tunick .	6 1 64 18 19 35 6 80 66 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 0 0 0 1 10
While he adds that he has no problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial interest , It ought not to be hidden in some small print .	39 23 65 66 23 11 6 1 12 0 1 33 11 1 12 124 23 11 6 0 1 2 23 64 16 18 74 40 38 6 0 1 10
In such situations , he says , the house is going to put the best light on things .	59 52 1 2 23 34 2 6 1 37 113 18 5 6 0 1 7 1 10
For example , an auction house 's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with very open eyes , he says .	59 1 2 6 0 1 42 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 33 28 53 7 1 4 74 172 7 38 36 0 1 2 23 27 10
There 's more and more of this cash-up-front going on at every level , says Bruce Miller , president of Art Funding Corp. , an art lender .	50 834 1 13 1 12 6 1 120 35 38 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 10
Dealers and auction houses know if they do n't lay out a half a million for this , another one will ; it 's that competitive .	1 13 0 1 44 39 23 4 35 19 35 62 52 6 1 38 23 2 6 1 34 91 23 28 29 24 10
In January , two small New York galleries , the Coe Kerr Gallery and Beadleston Fine Arts , snatched a major art collection owned by the Askin family away from rival auction-house bidders with an up-front payment of about $ 25 million .	59 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 136 6 0 0 1 40 38 6 0 1 53 7 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 12 0 86 0 9 10
A Christie 's spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes waives its seller 's commission to attract art works -- it still gets a commission from the buyer -- Christie 's wo n't offer financial guarantees because Christie 's believes its primary role is as an auction house , and therefore as an agent -LCB- for buyer and seller -RCB- , not as a bank .	6 1 42 1 65 66 39 6 0 1 16 11 6 1 42 1 18 19 0 1 30 23 16 11 6 1 38 6 1 106 0 1 4 35 19 0 1 30 0 1 44 6 0 1 48 7 6 0 1 2 13 161 7 6 1 166 12 1 13 1 167 2 161 7 6 1 10
Egon Krenz , the man tapped yesterday to become East Germany 's new leader , faces the same task that has fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues : reforming a country in crisis .	0 1 2 6 1 17 35 18 19 0 1 42 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 33 20 169 7 0 0 1 93 32 6 1 12 1 10
But unlike the other new leaders in the East Bloc , Mr. Krenz will face an immediate threat to his nation 's very existence : German reunification .	76 59 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 10
Mr. Krenz , age 52 , is known as an old-guard ironfist , one likely to continue the method of running a country that the Berlin Wall made famous .	0 1 2 1 123 2 14 22 7 6 0 1 2 1 43 18 19 6 1 93 32 6 1 138 6 0 1 136 24 10
Even if he were to change his stripes and become another Milton Friedman , however , he would still stand a good chance of losing a country .	137 39 23 64 18 19 6 1 13 19 6 0 1 2 76 2 23 4 35 19 6 0 1 93 32 6 1 10
Mr. Krenz almost certainly will be a younger version of Erich Honecker , his rigid predecessor as dictator .	0 1 72 16 4 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 10
Mr. Krenz has followed much the same career path as Mr. Honecker : Both spent years overseeing the Freie Deutsche Jugend , the youth group that is the communist regime 's principal tool for stamping young Germans into socialist citizens .	0 1 20 21 52 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 104 23 235 1 32 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 33 11 6 0 1 42 0 1 93 111 0 1 7 0 1 10
More recently , Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security , and is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo .	137 76 2 0 1 20 169 7 1 12 0 0 1 2 13 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Faced with another Mr. Honecker , so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German peoples will get their reunification , de facto , on West German ground .	22 7 6 0 1 2 36 0 0 0 1 28 43 18 79 30 6 0 0 1 4 19 6 1 2 67 35 2 38 0 0 1 10
But if East Germany 's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough to permit Mr. Krenz to make serious efforts at reform , he will face a challenge just as fundamental .	76 39 0 1 42 0 1 4 79 35 500 18 134 0 1 18 19 0 1 12 1 2 23 4 19 6 1 29 29 24 10
Abandoning socialism means abandoning the East German state 's reason for existence , and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall .	32 1 37 32 6 0 0 1 42 1 12 1 2 13 240 23 6 1 12 6 1 13 6 1 10
In this scenario it 's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the Federal Republic could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie -- economic , federal or stronger -- with West Germany .	59 6 1 192 193 24 18 77 66 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 4 168 182 40 38 6 1 12 1 106 24 2 24 13 24 106 12 0 1 10
Mr. Krenz may need a bit of time to consolidate his empire , which would do a lot to promote Reunification Scenario One .	0 1 4 134 6 1 12 1 18 19 6 1 2 90 4 19 6 1 18 19 0 1 123 10
Cartoonists in West Germany have already mocked the exodus by imagining an advertisement placed by Mr. Honecker : Wanted : one people .	1 12 0 1 20 35 21 6 1 57 32 6 1 40 38 0 1 106 12 106 0 1 10
The West German embassies in Prague , Budapest and Warsaw are continuing to find refugees at their gates .	6 36 0 1 12 1 2 1 13 1 37 113 18 19 1 38 6 1 10
Of course East Germany , true to its tradition , could tighten its borders yet further .	59 1 0 1 2 53 7 6 1 2 4 19 6 1 67 35 10
Two of the last gestures of the Honecker regime were to close the border to Czechoslovakia and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier .	1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 64 18 19 6 1 12 1 13 19 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
But with world-wide opinion -- even , apparently in Moscow -- against East Germany , the country would have to turn itself into an Albania to clamp down further on refugees .	76 59 0 1 106 69 2 69 12 1 106 12 0 1 2 6 1 4 154 18 5 23 7 6 1 18 87 35 35 7 1 10
There have been some reports that Mr. Krenz is moving to soften his reputation , notably rumors that it was he who kept East Germany 's state police off protesters ' backs at the country 's dismal 40th anniversary celebrations earlier this month .	50 150 21 6 80 66 0 1 37 113 18 19 6 1 2 52 80 66 192 233 23 33 73 0 1 42 0 1 7 1 42 1 38 6 1 42 0 0 0 1 67 81 1 10
But even if he effects a Hyde-to-Jekyll transformation , he will face a serious ideological crisis and Reunification Scenario Two .	76 137 39 23 11 6 0 1 2 23 4 19 6 0 0 1 13 0 1 123 10
The problem is one that East Germany shares with other half-states , such as North Korea , but one it must shoulder alone in the East Bloc .	6 1 11 1 138 0 1 73 7 0 1 2 69 12 0 1 2 13 1 23 4 19 35 38 6 0 1 10
When Poland moves to reform , it can at least lean on its past : However flawed and short-lived Joseph Pilsudski 's interwar republic , it was a nonsocialist democracy .	39 1 64 18 79 2 23 4 460 148 87 7 6 1 104 777 24 13 24 0 1 42 0 1 2 23 11 6 0 1 10
Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country .	0 1 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Even the Soviet Union has Peter the Great to rediscover , should it choose to .	52 6 0 1 11 52 6 1 18 19 2 437 23 154 236 10
But East Germany is merely the land of truly existing socialism .	76 0 1 11 35 6 1 12 36 0 1 10
Beyond that , it has to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity .	59 23 2 23 64 18 87 7 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Up to now , the main weapon of the worker and peasant state has been the ideology of socialism .	122 7 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 13 0 1 20 21 6 1 12 1 10
With talk today of a second economic miracle in West Germany , East Germany no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league .	59 1 78 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 72 16 4 5 23 155 32 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Without Moscow 's military and party behind it , East Germany runs the risk of disintegrating .	59 1 42 1 13 1 12 23 2 0 1 11 6 1 12 1 10
If it goes capitalist , and increases trade with West Germany , it will convert itself , willy-nilly , into an economic annex of the Federal Republic .	39 23 28 24 2 13 11 1 12 0 1 2 23 4 5 23 2 35 2 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
There 's a certain cruel logic at work here : It 's particularly appropriate -- and tragic -- that the land that produced Karl Marx should prove socialism 's failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls .	50 1299 6 0 0 1 7 1 35 104 192 383 29 24 106 13 24 106 66 6 1 33 11 0 1 4 19 1 42 1 38 6 1 33 73 6 0 1 7 1 10
There may be forces that would delay this scenario .	50 190 19 1 33 4 19 6 1 10
Ideologues are the last to surrender , and Germans are an ideological people .	1 11 6 1 18 79 2 13 1 11 6 0 1 10
The protesters who greeted Mikhail Gorbachev at East Berlin 's airport earlier this month were n't shouting Go U.S.A -- they were chanting Gorby , Help Us .	6 1 33 11 0 1 38 0 1 42 1 67 81 1 37 35 120 38 1 104 23 37 449 16 2 19 23 10
Ideologues on the other side of the border can also slow the process .	1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 4 35 19 6 1 10
Helmut Kohl 's governing conservative coalition is proving admirably true to the West German constitution by making more than 500,000 people of German descent automatic citizens this year alone .	0 1 42 0 0 1 37 156 29 53 7 6 0 0 1 57 146 24 25 0 1 12 0 1 0 1 81 1 208 10
But within the government and in the think tanks outside it , many West Germans maintain that they do n't want immediate reunification .	76 59 6 1 13 59 6 0 1 12 23 2 0 0 1 65 66 23 4 35 19 0 1 10
Politically , this currently is wisdom -- particularly given a nervous neighboring France .	76 2 23 16 11 1 67 67 38 6 0 0 1 10
But it would be ironic if Germany 's reunification , just like its division , eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than Bonn and Berlin .	76 23 4 115 24 30 1 42 1 2 72 85 6 1 2 16 11 6 1 12 1 12 1 12 1 78 112 1 13 1 10
In a statement that was as close as East Germany gets to practicing glasnost , Otto Reinhold , an East German party theorist , actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma .	59 6 1 33 28 29 24 47 0 1 34 399 32 1 2 0 1 2 6 36 0 0 1 2 16 11 6 0 1 10
The main problem , Mr. Reinhold said in an East German radio interview monitored by Radio Free Europe in Munich , stems from the fact that the GDR is different from other East European states .	6 0 1 2 0 1 44 38 6 36 0 0 1 40 38 0 0 1 12 1 2 48 7 6 80 66 6 1 28 53 7 0 36 0 1 10

While Mr. Woodland does n't predict a significant climb for the U.S. unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world , he noted that its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- impressively limited .	39 0 1 4 35 5 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 38 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 2 23 65 66 6 0 1 28 29 13 106 1300 0 1 106 29 24 10

Since Friday 's dive in stock market prices , the Fed has injected reserves into the banking system in an effort to calm the markets and avert a repeat of 1987 's stock market debacle .	59 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 1 20 21 1 38 6 0 1 38 6 1 18 19 6 1 13 19 6 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 10
Some analysts note that after last week 's stock market tailspin and Tuesday 's California earthquake , it 's hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate .	6 1 65 66 59 0 1 42 0 0 1 13 1 42 0 1 2 192 193 24 18 194 55 6 0 1 11 6 0 0 0 1 10
They say that the earthquake , by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity , has given the Fed an additional reason to keep liquidity at a high level .	23 65 66 6 1 2 211 111 0 1 155 120 38 0 1 2 20 114 6 1 6 0 1 18 19 1 38 6 0 1 10

Analysts said the additional liquidity should tend to reduce the federal funds rate .	1 44 6 0 1 4 154 18 19 6 0 0 1 10

Some dealers noted that nervousness over the recent sharp dive in stock prices could intensify following suggestions by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that appeared to advise Japanese investors to be very careful in investing in U.S. leveraged buy-outs .	6 1 65 66 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 4 79 38 1 12 0 71 1 0 0 1 33 64 18 134 0 1 18 115 29 24 57 45 7 0 0 1 10

Crude prices spurted upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to San Francisco area refinery complexes , but the rise quickly fizzled when it became apparent that oil operations were n't severely curtailed .	0 1 34 35 38 0 1 38 6 80 66 0 0 1 48 7 0 0 0 0 1 2 13 6 1 16 34 30 192 383 24 66 0 1 14 35 16 40 10

At the opening of the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate for November delivery shot up 10 cents a barrel , to $ 20.85 , still on the belief that the refineries were damaged .	59 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 1 34 35 67 35 294 1 2 38 86 9 2 67 38 6 80 66 6 1 14 40 10
In the San Francisco area , roughly 800,000 barrels a day of crude , about a third of all the refining capacity in California , is processed daily , according to industry data .	59 6 0 0 1 2 36 0 1 92 1 12 1 2 52 6 1 12 52 6 0 1 12 1 2 14 40 35 2 70 7 0 1 10
For more than the past year , even the rumor of a major West Coast refinery shutdown has been enough to spark a futures rally because the gasoline market is so tight .	59 1 12 6 0 1 2 52 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 0 1 20 164 43 18 19 6 0 1 30 6 0 1 28 29 24 10
But yesterday , as the morning wore on , some major West Coast refinery operators -- including Chevron Corp. , Exxon Corp. and the Shell Oil Co. unit of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group -- said their refineries were n't damaged and were continuing to operate normally .	76 76 2 39 6 1 28 24 2 6 0 0 0 0 1 106 12 0 1 2 0 1 13 6 0 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 106 44 6 1 14 35 40 13 37 113 18 79 35 10

Gasoline terminals were also largely unhurt , they said .	0 1 28 35 29 24 2 23 27 10

The market was basically acting on two contradictory forces , said Nauman Barakat of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .	6 1 37 35 120 38 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
One is the panic , the earthquake in San Francisco , which is positive .	1 11 6 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 2 33 28 24 10
But once that factor was eliminated , traders took profits and focused on crude oil inventories , Mr. Barakat said .	76 39 6 1 14 40 2 1 11 1 13 48 7 0 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
After the market closed Tuesday , the American Petroleum Institute had reported that crude stocks increased by 5.7 million barrels in the week ended Friday , which traders viewed as bearish .	39 6 1 34 76 2 6 0 0 1 20 174 66 0 1 34 38 36 0 1 38 6 1 40 35 2 138 1 73 46 24 10
But some market players still think earthquake speculation could have more impact on the oil markets .	76 6 0 1 16 44 0 1 4 19 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The problem is that while on the surface everything is all right , the question is , said Mr. Barakat , was there any structural damage to the pipelines or anything else .	6 1 65 66 39 59 6 1 23 28 29 24 2 6 1 249 2 56 0 1 2 1047 50 6 0 1 12 6 1 13 23 24 10

The December contract declined 1.85 cents a pound to $ 1.2645 .	6 0 1 34 67 35 294 1 38 86 9 10
According to one analyst , workers at the Cananea copper mine in Mexico , which has n't been operating since it was declared bankrupt by the Mexican government in late August , are set to return to work .	122 7 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 33 20 35 121 120 30 23 14 152 24 38 6 0 1 38 0 1 2 28 43 18 79 38 1 10

He added that , while there has n't been any official announcement as yet , the Highland Valley mine strike in British Columbia , which has lasted more than three months , is regarded as settled .	23 65 66 2 39 50 150 35 21 6 0 1 38 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 20 21 24 25 0 1 2 14 312 388 40 10
Another analyst said the Cananea return to operation may not be as near as some expect .	6 1 44 6 0 1 12 1 4 35 115 29 24 47 23 34 10
There are still negotiations taking place on whether there will be a loss of jobs , which has been a critical issue all along , he said .	50 51 35 1 32 1 375 55 50 190 19 6 1 12 1 2 33 20 21 6 0 1 67 35 2 23 27 10
Nevertheless , the increasing likelihood that these two major supply disruptions will be resolved weighed on the market , the analysts agreed .	76 2 6 0 80 66 6 0 0 0 1 4 74 40 48 7 6 1 2 6 1 27 10
Both of these mines are normally major suppliers of copper to Japan , which has been buying copper on the world market .	23 12 6 1 11 35 0 1 12 1 12 1 2 33 20 121 32 1 38 6 0 1 10
The first analyst said that the Japanese , as well as the Chinese , bought copper earlier in the week in London , but that this purchasing has since slackened as the supply situation , at least over the long term , appears to have improved .	6 0 1 65 66 6 1 2 102 102 13 6 1 2 11 1 70 7 6 1 38 1 2 13 66 6 1 20 35 60 30 6 0 1 2 363 148 85 6 0 1 2 64 18 163 60 10
The focus for some time has been on the copper supply , and good demand has been taken for granted , he said .	6 1 85 6 1 20 169 7 6 0 1 2 13 0 1 20 151 312 388 40 2 23 27 10
Now that the supply situation seems to be improving , it would be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side .	137 39 6 0 1 64 18 168 120 2 192 283 579 24 198 1 18 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
He noted the Commerce Department report yesterday that housing starts in September dropped 5.2 % from August to 1.26 million units on an annualized basis , the lowest level in seven years .	23 11 6 0 0 1 78 75 0 1 85 1 34 67 35 38 1 38 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Along with these factors , other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy , which could mean reduced copper usage , he said .	137 59 6 1 2 0 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 33 4 19 0 0 1 2 23 27 10

The announcement was made because of reports Tuesday that Cuba would delay shipments to Japan scheduled for later this year , into early next year .	6 1 14 40 70 7 1 78 75 1 4 19 1 12 1 22 7 52 6 1 2 38 0 0 1 10

Researchers say they believe FK-506 is 100 times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection drug , cyclosporine , made by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Sandoz Ltd .	1 44 23 44 1 28 116 29 29 24 84 6 0 0 1 2 1 2 40 38 0 0 0 0 1 10
They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK-506 , compared with cyclosporine , which can cause renal failure , morbidity , nausea and other problems .	23 14 35 40 38 6 36 0 0 1 12 1 2 230 7 1 2 33 4 19 0 1 2 1 2 1 13 0 1 10
The side effects -LCB- of cyclosporine -RCB- have made the penalty for its success rather high , Dr. Starzl said .	6 0 1 166 12 1 167 20 170 6 1 12 6 1 29 24 2 0 1 27 10
Dr. Fung said that FK-506 would not be available in the market for at least a year , and that the FDA approval process usually takes three years to five years .	0 1 65 66 1 4 35 115 24 38 6 1 38 296 148 6 1 2 13 66 6 0 0 1 16 11 0 1 12 0 1 10
There are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the University of Pittsburgh , whose hospital performs the most transplants in the world .	50 51 6 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 38 6 1 12 1 2 135 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market , but they said FK-506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by 50 % and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients .	1 4 35 19 6 1 12 6 1 75 23 11 6 1 2 13 23 44 1 4 134 1 18 19 0 1 38 0 1 13 19 6 1 12 0 1 17 18 19 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 38 0 1 10
Dr. Starzl said the research has been largely financed by the National Institute of Health and by university funds , and that Fujisawa did n't give the hospital any grants .	0 1 44 6 1 20 151 35 40 38 6 0 1 12 1 13 38 0 1 2 13 66 1 4 35 221 6 1 6 1 10
He said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug .	23 65 66 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
We 've known for six months the effect of this drug , and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company 's stock , Dr. Starzl said , adding that profiting from FK-506 would n't be ethical .	23 20 21 38 0 1 6 1 12 6 1 2 13 6 1 12 6 1 20 94 16 18 19 6 1 42 1 2 0 1 27 2 207 66 45 7 1 4 35 115 24 10
Economist David N. Laband 's Sept. 27 editorial-page article , In Hugo 's Path , a Man-Made Disaster , decries the control of price gouging , swiftly ordered by South Carolina 's governor after Hurricane Hugo .	0 0 0 1 42 0 0 0 1 2 734 1 42 1 2 6 0 1 2 11 6 1 12 0 1 2 16 40 38 0 1 42 1 38 0 1 10
According to Mr. Laband , screaming for price controls occurs when income redistribution threatens to hit home .	122 7 0 1 2 45 7 0 1 34 30 0 1 64 18 19 1 10
To be sure , the threat has hit home down here .	18 115 24 2 6 1 20 21 1 67 35 10
Yet in Mr. Laband 's rehash of free-market logic , human greed and self-interest are the only permissible psychological reactions .	76 59 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 13 1 11 6 0 0 0 1 10
Allowing uncontrolled prices for necessities would indeed shorten the lines at stores , as he contends .	32 0 1 12 1 4 35 19 6 1 12 1 2 30 23 34 10
But not because resources are going to their most efficient use , leaving scarce goods allocated to those buyers who place the highest value on them .	76 1301 346 1 37 120 38 6 36 0 1 2 571 0 1 22 7 6 1 33 73 6 0 1 7 23 10
Rather , lines would diminish because at higher prices many victims could not afford necessities such as food and medical supplies .	76 2 1 4 79 30 59 0 1 0 1 4 35 19 1 69 12 1 13 0 1 10
It is inhumane to imply that a poor , unemployed woman can not receive immediate relief for her family at fair prices because she does not have as much to protect as a rich family .	192 193 24 18 77 66 6 0 2 0 1 4 35 19 0 1 12 6 1 38 0 1 30 23 4 35 19 0 1 18 19 12 6 0 1 10
Moreover , essential relief supplies such as ice must be distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from spoiled food and possible outbreak of disease .	76 2 0 0 1 69 12 1 4 74 40 38 6 1 70 7 0 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 12 1 10
Such spillover effects give the state a right to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources .	52 0 1 108 6 1 6 1 18 79 38 6 1 13 16 19 1 12 1 10

These latter-day scalawags would be ill-advised to take advantage of the situation , if they ever expect to face the people of South Carolina again .	6 0 1 4 115 43 18 5 1 7 6 1 2 30 23 16 64 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 35 10
The government is actually protecting avaricious ice-baggers and other profiteers who can not see beyond their own short-term gain .	6 1 37 35 32 0 1 13 0 1 33 4 35 87 7 6 0 0 1 10
South Carolina deserves an A for its quick and timely relief efforts .	0 1 11 6 1 38 6 0 13 0 0 1 10
Mr. Laband , meanwhile , gets an A for his rote recital of economic-efficiency arguments .	0 1 2 16 2 11 6 1 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Give him an F for his failure to understand the ethics of economic equity .	221 23 6 1 38 6 1 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 10

Mr. Laband gives us an idea why economists ' predictions are usually wrong .	0 1 108 23 6 1 75 1 42 1 28 35 24 10

I 'm surprised he did n't advocate letting people loot , since that behavior can also be foreseen in a disaster and every individual has an incentive to alter the distribution of income in his favor .	23 28 285 23 4 35 168 278 1 79 2 30 6 1 4 35 74 40 38 6 1 13 6 1 11 6 1 18 19 6 1 12 1 38 6 1 10

Would Mr. Laband also suggest that the Red Cross , Salvation Army , military units , police , fire departments , rescue units and individual citizens cease their efforts to assist Hugo 's victims because they interfere with his concept of the free market ?	244 0 1 185 77 262 6 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 19 6 1 18 19 1 42 1 30 23 48 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 10

This seems to be the season for revivals in Chicago .	23 64 18 19 6 1 12 1 38 1 10
Though the Cubs ' championship season ended with the National League playoffs , a revival of the Organic Theater 's production of Bleacher Bums , a play in nine innings set in the Wrigley Field bleachers , continues within spitting distance of the ballpark .	39 6 1 42 0 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 2 34 38 0 1 12 6 1 10

Each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship , but both help explain why Chicago remains a vital center of this country 's regional theater movement .	23 28 29 24 84 6 0 0 0 1 2 13 23 4 194 55 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 0 1 10
The Goodman is offering a modernized version of Moliere 's The Misanthrope through Nov. 4 .	6 1 37 32 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 38 86 9 10
The original is a comedy about Alceste , a man who sees falseness and vanity in everyone except himself .	6 1 11 6 1 12 1 2 6 1 33 11 1 13 1 38 23 12 23 10
He is the jealous friend of Philinte , and the jealous lover of Celimene .	23 11 6 0 1 12 1 2 13 6 0 1 12 1 10
The play is filled with intrigue , dishonesty and injustice .	6 1 14 22 7 1 2 1 13 1 10
Twenty-five years ago the poet Richard Wilbur modernized this 17th-century comedy merely by avoiding the zounds sort of thing , as he wrote in his introduction .	0 1 234 6 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 67 57 32 6 0 1 12 1 2 30 23 34 38 6 1 10
Otherwise , the scene remained Celimene 's house in 1666 .	76 2 6 1 11 1 42 1 12 1 10
Assuming modern audiences readily understand that Moliere 's social indictment covers their world as well as 17th-century Paris , Mr. Wilbur concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the Alexandrine French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter .	214 0 1 16 65 66 1 42 0 1 11 6 1 102 102 13 0 1 2 0 1 73 6 0 1 155 111 6 0 0 1 7 0 13 0 0 0 1 10

But if you happen to be coming to Chicago in the next few weeks , do n't fail to have a look at Robert Falls 's The Misanthrope at the Goodman .	16 337 23 64 18 168 120 38 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 4 35 154 18 5 6 1 7 0 1 42 0 1 217 6 1 10
If Mr. Wilbur 's translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th-century Paris , Mr. Falls 's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves .	39 0 1 42 1 11 6 36 0 1 12 124 23 11 6 1 13 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 42 1 11 6 1 12 124 23 11 23 10
Mr. Falls , the Goodman 's artistic director , took a recent adaptation by Neil Bartlett and significantly adapted it .	0 1 2 6 1 42 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 16 11 23 10
Mr. Bartlett had slimmed Moliere 's cast of characters to six and set them in the London media world of Thatcherite Britain .	0 1 20 139 1 42 1 12 1 7 1 13 21 23 38 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
Mr. Falls transfers the setting to Hollywood , and transforms the characters into what passes for aristocracy there -- agents , producers , actors , writers and sycophants .	0 1 11 6 1 38 1 2 13 73 6 1 7 118 48 7 1 35 12 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 10
It works .	23 34 10
Mr. Bartlett managed to more or less maintain Moliere 's Alexandrine verse form , 12 syllable lines in rhyming couplets .	0 1 64 18 16 13 16 19 1 42 0 0 1 2 36 0 1 12 0 1 10
Mr. Falls kept the form , but Americanized it with Mr. Bartlett 's further help .	0 1 11 6 1 2 13 11 23 38 0 1 42 0 1 10
With a splendid cast led by David Darlow as Alceste , Christina Haag as Celimene and , especially , William Brown as a Philinte who plays the Hollywood game but harbors authentic values and feelings , the Goodman production barrels through an all-night Hollywood party with exuberance and wit .	59 6 0 1 40 38 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 12 1 13 2 52 2 0 1 12 6 1 33 11 6 0 1 13 11 0 1 13 1 2 6 0 1 48 7 6 0 0 1 38 1 13 1 10
If this version , with its references to Steven Spielberg , Spago and thirtysomething attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version , then Messrs. Bartlett and Falls are justified in abandoning Mr. Wilbur .	39 6 1 2 12 6 1 12 0 1 2 1 13 1 11 0 1 33 4 115 53 7 6 0 1 2 76 0 1 13 1 28 24 57 32 0 1 10
A 300-year-old play may be easier to revive than one merely 25 .	6 0 1 4 115 127 18 19 84 1 69 78 10
The Steppenwolf Theatre Company , back from a critical and box office success in London with its adaptation of Steinbeck 's The Grapes of Wrath , opened the new season with Harold Pinter 's The Homecoming , first produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1965 .	6 0 0 1 2 230 7 6 36 13 36 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 217 1 2 11 6 0 1 38 0 1 42 0 1 2 16 40 38 6 0 0 1 38 1 10
Back then , Mr. Pinter was not only the angry young British playwright , but also the first to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares , almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue .	137 76 2 0 1 11 62 52 6 0 0 0 1 2 13 261 6 1 18 19 1 13 0 1 13 0 1 2 67 38 6 1 12 119 23 16 82 18 19 0 1 10
When The Homecoming was first produced on this side of the Atlantic , actors and directors were reverential .	39 6 1 14 35 40 38 6 1 12 6 1 2 1 13 1 28 24 10
Silences were lengthy -- nobody moved or gestured .	1 28 24 104 23 34 13 34 10
Nobody smiled onstage , and nobody in the audience was encouraged to laugh .	23 34 35 2 13 23 12 6 1 14 17 18 79 10
This kind of theater was new to us .	6 1 12 1 28 24 38 23 10
Also , it was not a funny time over here , what with the Vietnam War , the '68 Democratic convention , assassinations and riots .	76 2 23 11 35 6 0 1 67 35 2 67 38 6 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 1 13 1 10
But under Jerry Perry 's direction the current Steppenwolf production , scheduled to play through Nov. 19 , breaks through the flat and boring ritual that The Homecoming had become .	76 59 0 1 42 1 6 0 0 1 2 17 18 79 38 86 9 2 48 7 6 0 13 0 1 138 6 1 20 21 10
Led by a near-perfect performance by Alan Wilder as Max , the father , the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family 's rage , bitterness , fear and isolation .	40 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 2 6 1 2 6 1 11 67 35 6 0 13 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 10

While Steppenwolf was in London with The Grapes of Wrath , Bruce Sagan , the president of its board of directors , quietly returned to Chicago to buy a piece of real estate in the city 's rapidly reviving North Halsted Street restaurant and theater district .	39 1 48 7 1 38 6 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 16 34 38 1 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 42 36 0 0 0 0 1 13 0 1 10

Steppenwolf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space .	1 11 6 0 1 67 35 68 6 0 1 10

The rest , he is confident , can be raised .	6 1 2 23 28 285 2 4 74 40 10

What will Mr. Sagan do with his new theater building if the allure of Hollywood and Broadway proves too much for such Steppenwolf stalwarts as John Malkovich -LRB- Dangerous Liaisons -RRB- , Joan Allen -LRB- The Heidi Chronicles -RRB- , and Glenne Headly -LRB- Lonesome Dove -RRB- , and the company crumbles ?	420 244 0 1 19 38 6 0 0 1 30 6 1 12 1 13 1 11 0 1 12 52 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 167 2 0 1 12 6 0 1 167 2 13 0 1 12 0 1 167 2 13 6 1 34 10

The budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the Oct. 15 deadline , and these Senate Democrats refused to agree to allow a vote to append capital gains to the budget bill , knowing it would pass .	6 0 1 64 18 74 172 7 38 6 0 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 64 18 154 18 19 6 1 18 5 0 1 7 6 0 1 2 214 23 4 79 10

It could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late this month , or it could follow the White House strategy , to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was appended .	23 4 19 35 6 1 13 154 18 79 38 0 1 67 81 1 2 13 23 4 19 6 0 0 1 2 18 19 1 30 0 1 14 40 10

At noon Friday , a senior White House official advised Richard Rahn , the Chamber 's chief economist , that the White House would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted in the Senate .	59 1 76 2 6 0 0 0 1 308 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 1 2 66 6 0 1 4 35 87 7 6 0 0 1 30 23 11 0 80 66 6 1 12 1 4 74 40 38 6 1 10
Two hours later , the first word emerged on Capitol Hill that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from Senate Democrats .	0 1 234 2 6 0 1 34 38 0 1 30 6 1 20 169 7 1 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Mr. Rahn was shocked , telephoning the office of Richard Darman , director of the Office of Management and Budget , and the administration 's chief strategist on this issue .	0 1 28 24 2 32 6 1 12 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 12 1 13 1 2 13 6 1 42 0 1 12 6 1 10
He left a message accusing Mr. Darman of selling out .	23 11 6 1 111 0 1 155 120 35 10
It was the Senate Republicans , though , who had edged away from the veto strategy .	192 233 6 0 1 2 35 2 33 20 60 70 7 6 0 1 10
The stock market reacted as Mr. Rahn did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that Mr. Darman 's strategy had been abandoned .	6 0 1 34 30 0 1 34 2 120 30 23 11 6 80 66 0 1 42 1 20 151 40 10
The stock market , after all , represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation 's capital stock , discounted to present value .	6 0 1 2 85 23 2 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 22 7 0 1 10
Why should it be so surprising that a 30 % cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation 's capital stock ?	243 886 192 556 29 24 66 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 4 19 52 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 10
The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ 15 trillion .	6 0 1 12 36 0 1 11 35 24 227 86 0 9 10
The value traded on the exchanges is close to $ 3 trillion .	6 1 40 38 6 1 11 0 0 86 0 9 10
If the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled , would n't the value fall to the owners of the assets ?	39 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 14 40 2 244 185 6 1 79 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
Is n't it reasonable to assume that the asset you own would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it , you would be able to keep 30 % more of its gain than you previously believed ?	1216 185 192 24 18 77 66 6 1 23 11 4 115 126 1 30 6 1 16 65 66 39 23 11 23 2 23 4 115 43 18 19 36 0 1 12 6 1 75 23 16 34 10
Indeed , the stock market 's steady advance this year tracked with President Bush 's success in advancing his capital-gains proposal .	76 2 6 0 1 42 0 1 92 1 34 38 0 1 42 1 93 32 6 0 1 10
A 30 % cut in this year 's capital gains alone amounts to roughly $ 50 billion .	6 36 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 78 48 7 0 86 0 9 10
We 're talking real money .	23 37 32 0 1 10
When Richard Rahn advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains , he was generally ignored and mildly ridiculed .	39 0 1 308 6 0 1 66 6 0 1 14 40 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 23 14 16 40 13 16 40 10
Instead , the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of United Airlines instantly knocked 7 % off the value of the nation 's capital stock and caused convulsions around the world .	76 2 6 0 1 16 11 6 80 66 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 16 73 0 1 7 6 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 13 11 1 38 6 1 10
Mr. Rahn was pointing out an elephant rumbling through Wall Street while conventional wisdom had fastened on the UAL flea .	0 1 37 32 35 6 1 120 38 0 1 30 0 1 20 169 7 6 0 1 10
Why is this happening ?	243 549 23 120 10
For one thing , quite a number of the leading spokesmen on Wall Street are not portfolio managers , who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets .	59 0 1 2 52 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 11 35 0 1 2 33 65 66 6 1 12 1 14 16 40 375 55 1 11 6 1 10
They are economists and financial reporters who sympathize with the view that a capital-gains tax cut benefits the rich .	23 11 1 13 0 1 33 48 7 6 80 66 6 0 0 1 11 6 1 10
Yet they somehow think that Wall Street is indifferent to losing the tax cut that seemed so close Friday morning and is now problematic .	76 23 16 65 66 0 1 28 53 155 32 6 0 1 33 436 29 24 0 1 13 28 35 24 10
The market rebound Monday followed weekend assurances from Mr. Darman that the administration has other plans to win the cut , which is alive and well .	6 0 1 16 11 0 1 12 0 1 75 6 1 11 0 1 18 19 6 1 2 33 28 24 13 24 10
Sen. Bradley 's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run .	0 1 42 1 65 66 6 0 0 1 4 115 24 38 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in 1990 , he thinks , when the White House is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets .	23 4 35 79 38 6 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 2 23 44 2 30 6 0 1 14 17 18 87 7 0 1 18 19 0 1 10
That is , with capital gains cut , the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone , and political realities will push up income-tax rates .	76 105 2 528 0 1 40 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 4 115 24 2 13 0 1 4 19 35 0 1 10
The counter-argument , which he has heard , is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president 's proposal , the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy .	6 1 2 138 23 20 21 2 65 66 39 23 13 6 0 1 28 53 155 32 6 1 42 1 2 6 0 1 4 79 35 35 38 1 70 7 6 0 1 10
In this atmosphere , there would be no serious consideration of tax increases .	59 6 1 2 50 190 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
If Sen. Bradley would permit a vote on capital gains , though , it would pass , Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market , the 1990 economy would be robust , and the revenue gains at every level of government , including New Jersey 's , would be surprisingly high .	39 0 1 4 19 6 1 12 0 1 2 76 2 23 4 79 2 0 0 1 4 115 24 102 13 53 7 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 4 115 24 2 13 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 12 0 0 1 2 4 115 29 24 10

But the offering almost did n't happen .	76 6 1 16 4 35 79 10

That 's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get .	23 11 35 119 0 0 0 1 37 32 2 13 23 44 23 11 0 0 1 75 23 4 79 10

Congress , with a measure of White House complicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills .	1 2 85 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 20 121 32 6 0 1 38 1 38 6 1 12 0 0 1 10

We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling .	23 44 1 14 22 35 7 6 1 10

Social Security and spending for poor people are exempted .	0 1 13 1 12 0 1 14 40 10
However , the Associated Press 's account of the Monday sequester order signed by President Bush neatly captured the contempt Congress shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment :	76 2 6 0 1 42 1 12 6 0 0 1 40 38 0 1 16 11 6 1 1 11 12 6 1 12 6 36 0 1 106

Mr. Darman 's inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater :	0 1 42 1 18 19 6 1 14 40 35 35 38 0 0 0 0 0 1 106
There is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go .	50 51 6 1 35 30 6 1 11 6 1 18 79 10

This attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around Washington as little more than tough talk .	6 1 37 182 22 35 38 1 12 1 7 0 1 12 0 1 10
It looks to us like a golden opportunity for George Bush to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid , unserious presidency .	23 48 38 23 7 6 0 302 198 0 1 18 19 35 38 6 1 52 6 1 12 6 0 2 0 1 10
Mr. Bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the Washington elites who manipulate these budgets -- the bureaucrats , the lobbyists , the congressional staffers -- live for just one year on a restricted diet .	0 1 4 168 120 38 6 0 1 30 23 282 6 0 1 33 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 2 6 0 1 106 87 38 36 0 1 7 6 0 1 10

Senator Phil Gramm pointed out Monday that in the 20 years before Gramm-Rudman was enacted in 1985 , federal spending grew by about 11 % a year ; since the law , it 's grown at under 5 % annually .	0 0 1 65 35 35 66 59 6 0 1 75 1 14 40 38 1 2 0 1 34 38 36 0 1 92 1 91 59 6 1 2 23 20 60 38 36 0 1 78 10
Another major factor in this positive trend was Ronald Reagan 's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 11 0 1 42 1 230 7 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 67 57 32 1 10
George Bush 's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring Congress to make choices among competing priorities , rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the PAC trough .	0 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 1 11 6 1 93 229 1 18 19 1 38 0 1 2 67 57 16 45 35 7 52 6 0 0 1 33 11 6 0 1 10
If Washington 's elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam , Americans will be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs , such as federalized child care .	39 1 42 1 16 48 155 32 6 0 1 2 1 4 74 40 38 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 69 12 0 0 1 10

THE STOCK of Applied Power Inc. , which split 2-for-1 in May , has risen since August 1988 .	6 1 12 0 0 1 2 33 28 24 38 1 2 20 60 38 1 123 10
In yesterday 's edition , it was incorrectly stated that the company 's share price has softened since August 1988 .	59 1 42 1 2 192 358 16 351 66 6 1 42 0 1 20 60 38 1 123 10
The stock market 's dizzying gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish they could buy some sort of insurance .	6 0 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 20 371 6 1 12 0 1 215 23 4 19 6 1 12 1 10
After all , they wo n't soon forget the stock bargains that became available after the October 1987 crash .	59 23 2 23 4 35 35 19 6 0 1 33 28 24 38 6 0 0 1 10
But while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now , they 're afraid of being hammered by another terrifying plunge .	76 39 23 64 18 87 7 6 1 12 0 0 1 35 2 23 28 53 155 182 40 38 6 0 1 10
The solution , at least for some investors , may be a hedging technique that 's well known to players in the stock-options market .	6 1 2 363 148 85 6 1 2 4 19 6 0 1 33 28 29 53 7 1 12 6 0 1 10
Called a married put , the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock .	15 6 0 1 2 6 1 14 40 35 57 32 6 1 13 16 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
It 's like fire insurance , says Harrison Roth , the senior options strategist at Cowen & Co .	23 48 7 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Because a put option gives its owner the right , but not the obligation , to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option 's expiration date , the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock 's price .	39 6 0 1 108 6 1 6 1 2 13 52 6 1 2 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 38 6 0 1 38 13 38 6 1 42 0 1 2 6 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 10
But most investment advisers do n't recommend using married puts all the time .	76 0 0 1 4 35 168 32 0 1 67 81 1 10
That 's because the cost of buying put options eats into an investor 's profit when stock prices rise .	23 397 346 6 1 93 32 0 1 34 38 6 1 42 1 30 0 1 34 10
This is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire , says Mr. Roth .	23 11 6 1 12 0 1 23 16 11 30 6 0 1 48 7 1 2 56 0 1 10
You always want your house insured , but you do n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured .	23 16 191 6 1 40 2 13 23 143 35 35 19 6 1 100 6 1 18 74 40 10
In addition to hedging new stock purchases , the married-put technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns .	59 1 93 32 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 4 74 17 18 19 1 138 6 1 16 11 10
In either case , the investor faces three possible outcomes :	59 6 1 2 6 1 11 0 0 1 106
-- If the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date , the put will probably expire worthless .	106 39 6 1 34 70 7 1 38 1 13 6 1 42 0 1 2 6 1 4 35 115 24 10
The investor will be out the cost of the put , which is called the premium , and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit .	6 1 4 115 126 6 1 12 6 1 2 33 14 15 6 1 2 13 6 1 4 19 6 0 1 10
-- If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date , the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put , less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put .	106 39 6 1 34 38 6 0 1 38 1 13 6 1 42 0 1 2 6 1 42 1 4 74 22 7 6 1 12 6 1 2 12 6 1 22 7 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
The worst-case scenario would be if the put expires worthless .	6 0 1 4 194 55 6 1 28 24 10
-- If the price of the stock declines , the put will increase in value .	106 39 6 1 12 6 1 34 2 6 1 4 79 38 1 10
Once the stock price is less than the exercise price , or strike price , of the put , the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar .	39 6 0 1 28 24 84 6 0 1 2 13 0 1 2 12 6 1 2 6 1 4 19 6 1 12 6 1 35 68 1 10
The put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life .	6 1 11 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 10
When a stock falls below the put 's strike price , the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit .	39 6 1 34 38 6 1 42 0 1 2 6 1 16 11 6 1 38 6 1 13 16 11 6 1 38 6 1 10
Or , the investor can exercise the put , by tendering the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock .	76 2 6 1 4 19 6 1 2 57 111 6 1 7 6 13 6 1 38 1 12 1 12 6 1 33 20 21 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Brokers handle such transactions through the Options Clearing Corp. , which guarantees all option trades .	1 11 52 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 10
The accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks .	6 0 1 162 55 6 1 4 79 38 0 1 10
Though not reflected in the table , an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays .	218 16 40 38 6 1 2 6 1 4 77 66 6 1 12 6 0 1 4 74 16 40 38 6 1 138 6 1 11 10
For example , Tenneco Inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents , which would be received before the February option expires and , thus , reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount .	59 1 2 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 4 74 40 30 6 0 1 34 13 2 16 2 19 6 1 93 32 6 1 38 6 1 10
In this case , the investor 's risk would n't exceed 3.6 % of the total investment .	59 6 1 2 6 1 42 1 4 35 19 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
To simplify the calculations , commissions on the option and underlying stock are n't included in the table .	18 19 6 1 2 1 12 6 1 13 0 1 14 35 40 38 6 1 10
There are more than 650 stocks on which options may be bought and sold , including some over-the-counter stocks .	50 51 24 25 0 1 12 124 1 4 74 40 13 40 2 12 6 0 1 10
But some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings .	76 6 1 4 19 6 0 1 93 120 140 24 208 10
They can do this by purchasing index puts , which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks .	23 4 19 23 57 32 0 1 2 33 11 35 0 1 12 1 33 11 0 1 12 1 10
For instance , the most popular index option is the S&P 100 option , commonly called the OEX .	59 1 2 6 36 0 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 2 16 15 6 1 10
It is based on the stocks that make up Standard & Poor 's 100-stock index .	23 14 40 38 6 1 33 11 35 0 0 1 42 0 1 10
Unlike options on individual issues , index options are settled only in cash , and no stock is ever tendered .	59 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 14 40 67 38 1 2 13 6 1 14 35 40 10
But while index options are convenient , they have several disadvantages .	76 39 0 1 28 24 2 23 11 0 1 10
For one thing , an investor 's portfolio might not closely match the S&P 100 .	59 0 1 2 6 1 42 1 4 35 16 19 6 1 123 10
As a result , the OEX insurance may or may not fully protect an investor 's holdings in the event of a market decline .	59 6 1 2 6 0 1 4 13 4 35 16 19 6 1 42 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
In addition , OEX options were suspended from trading last Friday afternoon , after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the S&P-500 futures contract was halted .	59 1 2 0 1 14 22 7 1 67 67 35 2 30 6 0 1 48 7 1 13 1 12 6 0 0 1 14 40 10
So an investor who wanted to realize a profit on OEX puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck .	76 6 1 33 64 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 38 6 0 1 4 163 169 161 7 1 10
On the other hand , only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on Friday .	59 6 0 1 2 52 6 1 12 0 1 14 22 7 1 38 1 10
Normally , once the underlying investment is suspended from trading , the options on those investments also do n't trade .	76 2 39 6 0 1 14 22 7 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 16 4 35 79 10
Ultimately , whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options .	76 2 55 6 1 40 57 32 1 28 24 354 7 6 1 12 6 1 10
That cost rises in times of high market volatility .	6 1 34 38 1 12 0 0 1 10
But it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit .	76 23 16 4 115 24 399 32 6 0 1 10
The protection from using married puts is clearly superior to that afforded by another options strategy some investors consider using during troubled times : selling call options on stocks the investor owns .	6 1 93 32 0 1 28 35 53 7 23 40 38 6 0 1 6 1 37 32 38 0 1 93 32 0 1 12 1 6 1 11 10
A call option is similar to a put , except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration .	6 0 1 28 53 7 6 1 2 130 66 23 108 6 1 6 1 18 19 1 38 6 0 1 38 1 10
Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline .	32 6 0 1 108 6 1 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
That 's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call .	23 397 346 23 11 6 1 12 6 1 38 6 1 12 1 40 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
But if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option , the stock is almost certain to be called away .	76 39 6 1 12 6 1 34 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 28 29 43 18 74 40 35 10
And in that case , the investor misses out on any major upside gain .	76 59 6 1 2 6 1 48 35 7 6 0 0 1 10
These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock .	6 1 11 6 1 12 1 40 13 1 40 38 6 1 10
All prices are as of Monday 's close .	6 1 48 161 7 1 42 1 10
Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the House version in advance of a House-Senate conference broke down .	1 12 0 1 12 0 0 1 34 30 1 18 19 6 0 1 38 1 12 6 0 1 34 35 10
House leaders had hoped to follow the Senate 's lead by getting an agreement from House committee chairmen under which they would drop items that would n't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the House-passed bill before the negotiations with the Senate began .	0 1 20 94 18 19 6 1 42 1 57 32 6 1 12 0 0 1 12 124 23 4 5 1 33 4 35 19 6 0 0 0 1 7 6 0 1 30 6 1 12 6 1 34 10
But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues , ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance .	76 6 1 14 40 38 6 1 12 118 4 87 7 0 1 2 120 57 32 6 0 1 38 0 1 38 1 12 0 1 10
Many members feel there are important features of the House bill that should be enacted , Speaker Thomas Foley -LRB- D. , Wash . -RRB- said .	0 1 44 50 51 0 1 12 6 0 1 33 4 74 40 2 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 27 10
If there is any support for reducing the bill , it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form .	39 50 51 6 1 93 32 6 1 2 23 14 22 7 6 1 18 191 23 40 38 6 1 10
Now those items will be discussed in a House-Senate conference , which could begin as soon as today , with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation .	76 6 1 4 74 40 38 6 0 1 2 33 4 79 67 70 7 1 2 38 6 80 66 23 4 16 74 40 35 13 79 38 0 1 10
You 've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out , said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- .	23 20 94 18 221 6 1 6 1 18 194 55 23 4 19 1 35 2 56 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 10

White House Budget Director Richard Darman has said he would continue to press to keep the capital-gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the House drops many of its costly provisions .	0 0 0 0 0 1 20 173 23 4 154 18 79 18 19 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 30 6 1 11 1 12 6 0 1 10
Senate leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to President Bush by the end of the week , but Speaker Foley said that was n't likely .	0 1 20 94 18 115 43 18 5 6 0 1 12 6 1 7 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 1 2 13 0 1 44 23 28 35 24 10

A surprising surge in the U.S. trade deficit raised fears that the nation 's export drive has stalled , and caused new turmoil in financial markets .	6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 11 80 66 6 1 42 0 1 20 60 2 13 11 0 1 38 0 1 10
The merchandise trade deficit widened in August to $ 10.77 billion , the Commerce Department reported , a sharp deterioration from July 's $ 8.24 billion and the largest deficit of any month this year .	6 0 0 1 34 38 1 38 86 0 9 2 6 0 1 44 2 81 0 1 68 1 42 86 0 9 13 81 0 1 68 6 1 92 1 10

This is one of the worst trade releases we 've had since the dollar troughed out in 1987 , said Geoffrey Dennis , chief international economist at James Capel Inc .	23 11 1 12 6 0 0 1 23 20 21 30 6 1 34 35 38 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Like most analysts , Mr. Dennis was hesitant to read too much into one month 's numbers ; but he said , It indicates perhaps that the balance in the U.S. economy is not as good as we 've been led to believe .	59 0 1 2 0 1 28 43 18 5 0 1 7 0 1 42 1 91 13 23 44 2 23 65 35 66 6 1 12 6 0 1 28 35 29 24 47 23 20 151 17 18 79 10
The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street , suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last Friday 's stock market slide .	6 1 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 207 66 36 0 0 1 4 19 0 1 42 0 0 1 10
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report 's release , before recovering to close 18.65 points lower at 2638.73 .	6 0 0 0 1 11 24 25 0 1 38 6 1 42 1 2 57 120 18 87 0 1 26 7 1 10
This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline , said Norman Robertson , chief economist for Mellon Bank .	6 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 10
It raises questions about more deep-seated problems , the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them .	23 11 1 12 36 0 1 2 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 1 18 87 7 1 38 23 10
The trade report drew yet another unsettling parallel to October 1987 .	6 0 1 11 36 0 0 1 12 1 123 10
On Oct. 14 of that year , the announcement of an unusually large August trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline .	59 86 9 12 6 1 2 6 1 12 6 36 0 0 0 1 368 11 6 0 0 1 10
The slide continued until the record 508-point market drop on Oct. 19 .	6 1 34 38 6 0 0 0 1 12 86 9 10
In 1987 , however , the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade , while the current report comes after a period of improvement .	59 1 2 76 2 6 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 1 2 30 6 0 1 34 38 6 1 12 1 10
The bleak trade report was played down by the Bush administration .	6 0 0 1 14 40 35 38 6 0 1 10
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called the worsening trade figures disappointing after two very good months .	0 0 0 1 136 6 0 0 1 24 38 0 36 0 1 10
And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the deficit was an unwelcome increase , adding that we 're hopeful that it simply is a one-month situation and will turn around .	76 0 0 0 0 1 44 6 1 11 6 0 1 2 207 66 23 28 266 66 23 16 11 6 0 1 13 4 79 35 10
But the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has run out of steam .	76 6 1 11 6 1 12 0 0 1 75 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 20 164 53 7 1 10
The figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $ 110 billion annual rate , said Jeffrey Scott , a research fellow at the Institute for International Economics here .	6 1 78 11 0 1 18 19 6 80 66 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 20 35 164 24 38 6 1 12 52 6 125 0 9 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 78 10
That 's still an improvement over last year , but it leads one to conclude that basically we 've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit .	23 11 35 6 1 12 0 1 2 13 23 82 23 18 77 66 76 23 20 170 52 6 1 23 11 53 7 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Exports declined for the second consecutive month in August , slipping 0.2 % to $ 30.41 billion , the Commerce Department reported .	1 34 38 6 0 0 1 38 1 2 120 67 35 38 86 0 9 2 6 0 1 27 10
Imports , on the other hand , leaped 6.4 % to a record $ 41.18 billion .	1 2 85 6 0 1 2 34 67 35 38 6 0 86 0 9 10
Not only was August 's deficit far worse than July 's , but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $ 7.58 billion deficit it had initially reported last month .	137 523 1312 1 42 1 29 24 84 0 1 2 76 6 1 73 6 0 1 35 7 6 125 0 9 1 23 20 35 21 67 35 10
Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur .	0 1 65 66 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 14 40 30 0 0 1 4 79 10
That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export .	23 397 346 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 52 0 1 13 0 1 2 32 6 1 42 1 18 79 10
People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits , but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem , said Mr. Robertson .	1 28 53 13 53 155 45 7 6 1 2 13 6 1 28 35 24 13 23 11 35 6 1 2 56 0 1 10
In addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness .	59 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 20 21 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 13 21 6 1 42 1 10
Since March , exports have been virtually flat .	59 1 2 1 20 164 29 24 10
At the same time , William T. Archey , international vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , notes : Clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive by causing their prices to decline .	59 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 44 106 76 6 0 1 20 170 1 29 24 57 229 6 1 18 79 10
Most economists expect the slowing U.S. economy to curb demand for imports .	0 1 82 6 0 0 1 18 19 1 12 1 10
But they foresee little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down .	76 23 11 0 0 1 12 1 30 6 1 13 6 0 0 1 34 35 10
The best result we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and Congress get serious about putting the U.S. on an internationally competitive economic footing , said Howard Lewis , vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers .	6 0 1 23 4 5 7 6 1 4 154 18 344 6 1 13 1 115 53 155 111 6 1 7 6 36 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
That must start with cutting the federal budget deficit .	23 4 87 155 32 6 0 0 1 10
August 's decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies , capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles , parts and engines .	1 42 1 12 1 11 1 12 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 13 1 78 13 1 12 1 12 0 1 2 1 13 1 10
The jump in imports stemmed from across-the-board increases in purchases of foreign goods .	6 1 12 1 48 7 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 10

Steve Jobs took a step back from the frontier of personal-computer technology in an effort to spur sales of Next Inc. 's new machine .	0 1 11 6 1 230 7 6 1 12 0 1 38 6 1 18 19 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 10
Mr. Jobs moved to remedy a couple of his computer 's drawbacks yesterday by lowering the entry-level price for a Next machine by $ 1,500 , or 23 % , if the buyer chooses a hard-disk drive as an alternative to Next 's optical-storage device .	0 1 64 18 19 6 1 12 6 1 42 1 35 57 32 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 38 86 9 2 13 0 1 2 30 6 1 11 6 0 1 38 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
The hard drive , which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user , also now will supplement Next 's futuristic optical device if buyers pay full price .	6 0 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 12 1 38 36 0 0 0 1 2 16 16 4 19 1 42 0 0 1 30 1 11 0 1 10
Mr. Jobs , co-founder of Apple Computer Inc. , founded Next four years ago in the hopes of fomenting a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used .	0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 2 11 1 0 1 26 38 6 1 93 32 6 1 12 6 1 0 1 14 40 13 40 10
His Next computer , introduced about a year ago and aimed primarily at university computer users , sports snazzy graphics , digital sound , built-in networking and a sleek black design .	6 0 1 2 40 52 6 1 26 13 22 161 7 0 0 1 2 11 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 10
But the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price , a lack of software and an optical data-storage device that was too slow .	76 6 1 37 32 6 0 1 70 7 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 1 13 6 0 0 1 33 28 29 24 10
The machine began shipping at the end of last year .	6 1 11 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 10
The closely held company has n't disclosed sales .	6 36 0 1 20 35 21 1 10
However , most universities that have bought the machines say they are buying small numbers for evaluation purposes .	76 2 0 1 33 20 21 6 1 44 23 37 32 0 1 38 0 1 10
Universities can now buy a Next computer without an optical storage device for $ 4,995 .	1 4 35 5 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 7 86 9 10
A computer with the optical device will still cost $ 6,495 , but from now on Next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought Next machines .	6 1 12 6 0 1 4 35 19 86 9 2 13 59 1 105 1 4 5 6 1 7 6 0 1 13 5 1 38 6 1 7 23 33 20 35 21 0 1 10
Commercial customers can purchase the same system through Businessland Inc. , a computer retailer based in San Jose , Calif. , for roughly $ 3,000 more .	0 1 4 19 6 0 1 38 0 1 2 6 0 1 40 38 0 1 2 1 2 38 0 86 9 24 10
Mr. Jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device , which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals .	0 1 44 6 1 14 40 38 1 12 1 33 14 22 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 33 14 35 40 38 0 1 38 6 1 10
Another factor was that customers were asking , Why do n't you give us a cheaper system ? Mr. Jobs said at a conference on university computing here .	6 1 65 66 1 37 1161 2 243 244 185 23 221 23 6 0 1 10 0 1 27 153 6 1 12 0 1 78 10
Optical-storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer .	0 1 4 19 36 0 1 12 1 13 540 192 29 24 18 19 0 1 13 0 1 38 6 1 10
But the technology , while reliable , is far slower than the widely used hard drives .	76 6 1 2 251 24 2 28 29 24 84 6 36 0 0 1 10
To get around the delays caused by the optical device , Businessland , which is Next 's exclusive dealer to corporations , has for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines .	18 87 7 6 1 40 38 6 0 1 2 1 2 33 11 1 42 0 1 12 1 2 20 38 1 121 229 1 18 19 0 1 38 6 1 10
Next 's decision to rely on the more-established hard drive in every Next computer does n't signal a retreat from optical storage , said Mr. Jobs , who for years has said this technology will play a crucial role in the next decade .	1 42 1 18 87 7 6 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 12 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 33 85 1 20 173 6 1 4 19 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
We 're extremely committed to optical storage technology he said .	23 14 16 22 7 0 0 1 23 27 10
We think everything will go this way in a few years .	23 44 23 4 79 81 1 38 6 0 1 10
He said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives , but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices .	23 65 66 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 115 29 53 7 0 1 2 13 23 48 7 0 1 38 6 1 10
But university computer specialists , who welcomed the move , called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase Next 's sales on campuses .	76 0 0 1 2 33 11 6 1 2 108 23 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 13 1 33 28 43 18 19 1 42 1 12 1 10
From the standpoint of being on the forefront of technology , this is a step backward , said Jerry W. Sprecher , a senior computing manager for the California state university system .	59 6 1 93 45 7 6 1 12 1 2 23 11 6 1 123 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
But it will definitely boost Next 's sales .	76 23 4 35 19 1 42 1 10
Universities , however , say Next 's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine .	1 2 16 2 44 1 42 1 4 115 29 24 30 0 1 12 1 11 6 1 10
We 'd still like to see a student model , priced at about $ 3,500 , said Ronald Johnson , director of academic computing at Minnesota 's Gustavus Adolphus College , which has bought eight Next machines .	23 4 35 154 18 19 6 0 1 2 22 7 0 86 9 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 2 33 20 21 0 0 1 10
Broad acceptance of Next 's computer also is hindered by difficulty in distributing software for it .	0 1 12 1 42 1 16 14 40 38 1 93 32 1 12 23 10
Most software is distributed on cheap floppy disks , but the Next computer does n't come with a device that reads them .	0 1 14 40 38 0 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 4 35 87 7 6 1 33 11 23 10
Next 's computer also needs more software applications , but Mr. Jobs said he expects more soon .	1 42 1 16 11 0 0 1 2 13 0 1 44 23 11 1 35 10
He said he expects Lotus Development Corp. to introduce a Next version of its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program in 1990 .	23 44 23 82 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 38 1 10
Educators added that Next needs to soon offer a color version of its computer .	1 65 66 1 64 18 35 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Every major maker offers computers with color displays .	6 0 1 11 1 12 0 1 10
Next wo n't comment on when it will do the same , but is believed to have a color model under development .	1 4 35 87 309 55 23 4 19 6 1 2 13 14 17 18 19 6 0 1 38 1 10

Ashton-Tate Corp. reported a net loss of $ 19.4 million , or 74 cents a share , for the third quarter , which was burdened by severance costs and the expense of upgrading its database software inventories .	0 1 11 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 92 1 2 38 6 0 1 2 33 14 40 38 0 1 13 6 1 93 32 6 0 0 1 10

Edward M. Esber , chairman , president and chief executive officer , attributed the decline to reduced domestic revenue because of $ 4.9 million spent to upgrade existing software inventories to the new database IV Version 1.1 , and $ 1.8 million spent on the recent reduction in work force .	0 0 1 2 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 2 73 6 1 7 0 0 1 230 7 86 0 9 40 18 5 0 0 1 7 6 0 0 0 1 123 2 13 86 0 9 22 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 10

The red ink came as no surprise to Wall Street , but analysts said they saw ominous hints of a further delay in volume shipments of Version 1.1 , a harbinger of continued losses in the fourth quarter .	6 0 1 34 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 13 1 44 23 11 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 123 2 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 10

The success of a new product in the database line is needed .	6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 14 40 10
And while the company has n't made a definite statement , it now looks like that 's not going to be anytime soon , Mr. Maxwell said .	76 39 6 1 20 35 21 6 0 1 2 23 16 48 273 23 37 35 113 18 115 29 24 2 0 1 27 10

It now looks like database IV Version 1.1 is n't going to be -LCB- widely -RCB- available until the first quarter of 1990 , said David Bayer , an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco .	23 16 48 273 0 0 1 123 37 35 113 18 115 1313 24 167 24 38 6 0 1 12 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 10
This is the second delay now in getting the product out the door .	23 11 6 0 1 78 93 111 6 1 7 6 1 10
It does prolong the pain somewhat .	23 4 19 6 1 35 10
Mr. Maxwell said unless the company can start shipments of the new product sometime this quarter , the fourth-quarter loss is likely to be comparable to the third quarter 's .	0 1 44 39 6 1 4 19 1 12 6 0 1 67 81 1 2 6 0 1 28 43 18 115 53 7 6 0 0 1 10

Thomas M. Hurley and Robert A. Vanourek , who had been designated to take over Recognition 's top spots had Prospect 's tender offer succeeded , were named co-chief executives and directors .	0 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 33 20 151 17 18 19 35 1 42 0 1 541 1 42 0 1 60 2 14 15 0 1 13 1 10

In addition , the agreement calls for Gilbert H. Lamphere , chairman of Prospect Group 's executive committee , to be named chairman of a restructured board that will include four new independent directors .	59 1 2 6 1 592 198 0 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 2 18 74 15 1 12 6 0 1 33 4 19 0 0 0 1 10

Prospect , a New York-based leveraged buy-out firm , also agreed to invest $ 15 million in Recognition , which in turn agreed to repurchase as much as $ 20 million of its stock .	1 2 6 36 0 0 0 1 2 16 64 18 5 86 0 9 7 1 2 33 85 1 64 18 19 366 24 7 86 0 9 12 6 1 10

Beyond that , Prospect said it would n't offer to acquire additional shares for less than $ 11.25 a share during the next year or less than $ 14.06 a share during the subsequent two years .	59 23 2 1 44 23 4 35 154 18 5 0 1 7 24 227 86 9 92 1 38 6 0 1 13 24 227 86 9 92 1 38 6 0 0 1 10
Recognition also said it obtained a commitment from Chemical Bank and Bank of Boston to convert an estimated $ 18 million in bank debt to a new , 24-month secured term loan to be repaid through the sale of certain assets .	1 16 44 23 11 6 1 38 0 1 13 1 12 1 18 5 6 0 86 0 9 12 0 1 7 6 0 2 0 0 0 1 18 74 40 38 6 1 12 0 1 10
In August , Recognition said it was in violation of certain terms of its debt agreements with bank lenders because of a $ 3.9 million loss for the third quarter ended July 31 .	59 1 2 1 44 23 48 7 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 70 7 6 125 0 9 1 12 6 0 1 40 8 9 10
The company attributed the loss to declining revenue and litigation costs relating to criminal charges against the company and two former executives , William G. Moore Jr. and Robert W. Reedy .	6 1 73 6 1 7 0 1 13 0 1 45 7 0 1 12 6 1 13 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 10

General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division , reacting to slow sales , said it will offer $ 800 rebates on its 1990 Beretta , the two-door version of its core compact-car line .	0 0 1 42 0 1 2 45 7 0 1 2 44 23 4 19 125 9 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Sluggish sales of the Beretta , and its four-door sister car , the Corsica , prompted GM to idle the two plants that build the automobiles for a total of three weeks this month .	0 1 12 6 1 2 13 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 2 82 1 18 19 6 0 1 33 11 6 1 38 0 1 217 0 1 81 1 10
The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet , but sales of the vehicles are off 9.6 % for the year , and fell a steep 34 % during early October .	6 1 13 1 11 35 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 13 1 12 6 1 28 126 0 1 38 6 1 2 13 34 81 0 0 1 38 0 1 10

Except to characterize its offer as fair and generous and in the best interests of Mesa shareholders , StatesWest declined to discuss details of its proposal .	1314 18 5 6 1 46 24 13 24 13 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 1 64 18 19 1 12 6 1 10
It also asked Mesa to keep the proposal confidential .	23 16 82 1 18 178 6 1 24 10
A Mesa official confirmed receipt of the offer and said directors would meet to consider it .	6 0 1 11 1 12 6 1 13 44 1 4 79 18 19 23 10
Last week , Mesa rejected a proposal by StatesWest to acquire it or merge .	137 76 2 1 11 6 1 12 1 18 19 23 13 79 10
StatesWest has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico , Arizona , Wyoming , Colorado and Texas .	1 11 6 36 0 1 12 1 2 33 11 0 0 13 0 0 1 38 0 1 12 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 10

The carrier has n't yet turned a profit .	6 1 20 35 35 21 6 1 10
The former president of FirstSouth F.A. , a defunct Arkansas thrift , pleaded guilty to conspiring to inflate the institution 's earnings by concealing worthless loan guarantees .	6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 28 53 155 113 18 19 6 1 42 1 57 32 0 0 1 10
Roderick D. Reed III , who was also chief operating officer of FirstSouth , could receive a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison and a $ 250,000 fine .	0 0 0 1 2 33 11 35 0 0 1 12 1 2 4 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 125 9 1 10
A sentencing date has n't been set .	6 0 1 20 35 151 40 10
Mr. Reed admitted he conspired to conceal an agreement not to enforce loan guarantees executed by Dallas real-estate developers A. Starke Taylor III and George S.

Neither Mr. Taylor nor Mr. Watson have been charged with criminal wrongdoing .	52 0 1 13 0 1 20 151 22 7 0 1 10
By concealing the non-enforcement agreement , certain transactions with Messrs. Taylor and Watson were entered on FirstSouth 's books as loans , allowing the thrift to report fees and interest as current income , according to the U.S. attorney 's office in Little Rock , Ark .	181 32 6 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 14 22 38 1 42 1 7 1 2 229 6 1 18 5 1 13 1 7 0 1 2 70 7 6 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 2 1 10
The conspiracy was part of an effort by Mr. Reed to hide FirstSouth 's shaky financial condition from federal regulators , according to federal prosecutors and regulators .	6 1 11 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 18 5 1 42 0 0 1 7 0 1 2 70 7 0 1 13 1 10
The $ 1.68 billion thrift was declared insolvent and closed in December 1986 .	6 125 0 9 1 14 152 24 13 34 38 1 123 10
FirstSouth 's former chairman and chief executive officer , Howard Weichern , is also charged with conspiring to conceal the agreements with Messrs. Watson and Taylor .	1 42 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 14 35 22 155 113 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 13 1 10

I approached Mastergate , Larry Gelbart 's new comedy at the Criterion Center , with considerable trepidation .	23 11 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 38 0 1 10
Nothing , I assumed , would be more hopelessly dated than a political satire on the Iran-Contra affair .	23 2 23 44 2 4 115 116 29 24 84 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
I had underestimated , however , both Mr. Gelbart 's wit and the persistence of scandal in Washington .	23 20 60 2 35 2 52 0 1 42 1 13 6 1 12 1 12 1 10
Though the play clearly is framed around the events of Iran-Contra , it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years .	39 6 1 16 14 22 7 6 1 12 1 2 23 11 35 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
In fact , at one point Merry Chase -LRB- Melinda Mullins -RRB- , a cool , carefully coiffed television announcer , recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years , concluding with those affecting the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the savings and loan industry .	59 1 2 59 0 1 0 1 12 0 1 167 2 6 0 2 36 0 0 1 2 11 6 1 12 52 6 13 6 1 12 0 1 2 45 7 23 32 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 13 6 0 13 0 1 10
Onstage , a congressional hearing is in progress , complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the Constitution in the background .	76 2 6 0 1 48 7 1 2 53 7 0 0 1 78 13 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 10

The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental .	6 1 12 1 28 35 29 24 10
Mr. Gelbart clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing -- the witnesses , the lawyers , the interrogators and the news media -- are performers .	0 1 16 65 66 52 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 2 6 1 13 6 0 1 106 11 1 10
As the story of Mastergate unfolds , we learn that the Internal Revenue Service confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes .	39 6 1 12 1 34 2 23 65 66 6 0 0 1 11 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 33 108 6 1 1 12 1 10

He himself lives in a consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in Switzerland .	23 78 34 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 10
The property seized by the IRS is a Hollywood film studio , Master Pictures Incorporated -LRB- MPI -RRB- .	6 1 40 38 6 1 11 6 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 1 167 10
Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI , but before it can , a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter , the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency .	76 6 1 4 19 35 6 1 12 1 2 13 39 23 34 2 6 0 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
The lowly agent , Abel Lamb , who as you might guess , is being led to the slaughter , is ordered to take over the studio .	6 0 1 2 0 1 2 33 337 23 4 79 2 37 182 40 38 6 1 2 14 17 18 19 35 6 1 10
Soon the studio is producing a $ 40 million picture called Tet , the Motion Picture , to distinguish it from Tet , the Offensive , as well as Tet , the Book and Tet , the Album .	76 6 1 37 32 6 125 0 9 1 15 1 2 6 0 1 2 18 5 23 7 1 2 6 1 2 102 102 13 1 2 6 1 13 1 2 6 1 10
The picture , to be made in the Central American country of San Elvador , is a cover for sending $ 800 million of arms to Los Otros , the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring Ambigua , which has been taken over by the leftist dictator Dr. Overtega , a former podiatrist , who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers .	6 1 2 18 74 40 38 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 2 11 6 1 93 32 86 0 9 12 1 38 0 1 2 6 0 1 113 18 19 0 1 2 33 20 151 40 35 38 6 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
The man handling all this for the now-deceased Slaughter is Major Manley Battle , Mr. Gelbart 's stand in for Col. Oliver North .	6 1 32 52 1 38 6 0 1 11 0 0 1 2 0 1 42 1 123 12 0 0 1 10
Director Michael Engler has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings .	0 0 1 20 21 6 0 1 18 19 35 6 1 12 0 0 1 13 18 19 6 0 1 238 16 79 35 38 0 1 10
Daniel von Bargen is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as Major Battle , mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism ; Jeff Weiss is fire , brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle ; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers ; Joseph Daly has the perfect aw , shucks demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president ; and Ann McDonough is first-rate as a succession of witnesses ' wives .	0 0 1 28 24 13 29 24 38 0 1 2 32 52 6 0 1 12 1 13 1 91 0 1 11 1 2 1 13 0 1 38 6 0 1 33 48 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 91 0 1 28 29 24 32 6 1 12 1 91 0 1 11 6 0 0 2 210 1 12 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 91 13 0 1 28 24 38 6 1 12 1 42 1 10
With one she is pregnant , with Major Battle she is knitting an American flag , and as the vice president 's wife she rushes in with white hair , wearing a tailored suit and pearls , imitating Barbara Bush 's gestures down to the last detail .	59 1 23 28 24 2 59 0 1 23 37 32 6 0 1 2 13 59 6 0 1 42 1 23 34 35 38 0 1 2 32 6 0 1 13 1 2 32 0 1 42 1 70 7 6 0 1 10
Though it 's clear that Mr. Gelbart 's sympathies do not lie with the far right , it 's also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs , taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media .	39 192 383 24 66 0 1 42 1 4 35 87 7 6 0 1 2 192 383 35 24 66 23 28 24 57 32 6 0 1 2 111 0 1 7 1 13 1 12 6 1 13 161 7 6 1 10
Mr. Gelbart also has fun with language .	0 1 16 11 1 38 1 10
Mastergate is subtitled a play on words , and Mr. Gelbart plays that game as well as anyone .	1 14 15 6 1 12 1 2 13 0 1 11 6 1 67 70 7 23 10
He describes a Mastergate flunky as one who experienced a meteoric disappearance and found himself handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs .	23 73 6 0 1 7 1 33 11 6 0 1 13 235 23 32 0 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 10
This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness , however .	6 1 12 1 34 38 1 13 1 2 35 10
Mr. Gelbart deplores the obfuscation , the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides .	0 1 11 6 1 2 6 1 13 6 1 12 1 23 11 38 6 1 10
As the hearings begin , the self-important Sen. Bowman -LRB- Jerome Kilty -RRB- announces : Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset : We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape .	39 6 1 34 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 167 4 106 344 23 19 0 1 38 6 1 30 23 37 35 45 7 1 18 19 13 1 18 19 10
Major Battle himself speaks in pure Pentagonese : Without further monetary-stroke-military aid , scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers , who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us , were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle .	0 1 78 48 7 0 1 104 59 0 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 2 33 20 60 67 70 7 6 1 13 1 38 23 2 14 16 40 35 38 6 1 38 6 1 10
At another point he intones : Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy .	59 6 1 23 44 106 1 11 6 0 1 18 5 7 1 10
The evening is short -- 95 minutes without an intermission -- but even so , as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. Gelbart 's satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably .	6 1 28 24 84 0 1 12 6 1 106 13 137 76 2 39 6 1 34 6 1 12 0 1 42 1 11 6 1 30 6 1 34 35 67 67 35 10
Most of the evening , though , is filled with rare and welcome wit .	1 12 6 1 2 16 2 14 22 7 0 13 0 1 10
In Mastergate , Mr. Gelbart has provided us not just one but two commodities that have all but disappeared from the Broadway theater : sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language .	59 1 2 0 1 20 114 23 36 36 0 13 0 1 33 20 72 16 60 38 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 6 36 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 10

The New Crowd by Judith Ramsey Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld -LRB- Little , Brown , 444 pages , $ 19.95 -RRB- , describes the displacing of the old our crowd Jewish Wall Street banking grandees by such new business barons as Saul Steinberg , Carl Icahn , Sanford Weill and Bruce Wasserstein .	6 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 12 0 2 1 2 0 1 2 86 9 167 2 11 6 1 12 6 78 78 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 52 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 10
Its many lively stories include the Gutfreund-Postel holiday cheer imbroglio .	6 0 0 1 11 6 0 0 0 1 10
These two New Crowd families lived in the same apartment building , with the Postel penthouse perched on top of the Gutfreund duplex .	6 0 0 0 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 2 441 6 0 1 40 38 1 12 6 0 1 10
The penthouse elevator started up from the Gutfreund landing , and Susan Gutfreund used to turn off its light , to give the impression that there was no higher floor .	6 0 1 34 35 38 6 0 1 2 13 0 1 64 18 19 35 6 1 2 18 19 6 80 66 50 51 6 0 1 10
Eventually , Mr. Postel broke his toe in the dark .	76 2 0 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 10
Then the Gutfreunds determined to put up a 22-foot Christmas tree , weighing a quarter of a ton , to amaze their holiday guests .	76 6 1 64 18 19 35 6 0 0 1 2 32 6 1 12 6 1 2 18 19 6 0 1 10
For this , a crane needed to be mounted on the Postels ' terrace .	59 23 2 6 1 64 18 74 40 38 6 1 42 1 10
The Postels did not give permission .	6 1 4 35 19 1 10
But the Gutfreund workers went ahead anyway , only to be captured in flagrante by Joan Postel , who called the police .	76 6 0 1 28 24 35 2 16 18 74 40 67 35 38 0 1 2 33 11 6 1 10
Before the Gutfreunds finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious duplex on Fifth Avenue and an 18th-century mansion with a specially excavated $ 1 million garage in Paris , the Postels had obtained an injunction to prevent any future hoisting of trees , and in a neighborly spirit hit both the Gutfreunds and the building with a $ 35 million lawsuit .	39 6 1 16 73 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 6 36 0 125 0 9 1 12 1 2 6 1 20 21 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 2 13 85 6 0 1 73 52 6 1 13 6 1 7 6 125 0 9 1 10
Nothing less , it seemed , could console them for their traumas .	23 78 2 23 44 2 4 19 23 38 6 1 10
Where had all the money come from ?	420 705 52 6 1 48 7 10
The young John Gutfreund had been discovered by Billy Salomon of Salomon Bros. when he was still a bearded liberal , and put to work as a trader , and then as a rough-and-tumble syndicator .	6 0 0 1 20 151 40 38 0 1 12 0 1 30 23 11 35 6 0 1 2 13 17 18 87 7 6 1 2 13 161 7 6 0 1 10
Get off your ... , he would bellow , say the authors .	87 7 1 106 2 23 1316 79 2 56 6 1 10
Rising in the firm , he became powerful and bland , though his new wife , Susan , made him shine in the gossip columns with her profligate spending habits and flamboyant frocks .	120 38 6 1 2 23 28 24 13 24 2 30 6 0 1 2 1 2 282 23 79 38 6 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 13 0 1 10
After he had been head of the company for 3 1\/2 years , he and his partners sold it to Phibro , a powerful commodity trading outfit , for $ 550 million in Phibro stock .	39 23 20 21 1 12 6 1 38 0 0 1 2 23 13 6 1 385 23 7 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 2 7 86 0 9 12 0 1 10
Limited partner Billy Salomon , whose family name had been on the firm 's door for 70 years and who had hoped it would be there forever , was not consulted .	0 0 0 1 2 135 0 1 20 169 7 6 1 42 1 38 0 1 13 33 20 173 23 4 115 24 35 2 14 35 40 10
Mr. Gutfreund collected $ 32 million , while Billy Salomon got $ 10 million , much less than if he had conducted the sale .	0 1 11 86 0 9 2 30 0 1 11 86 0 9 2 29 24 597 293 23 20 21 6 1 10

Worse , Salomon 's timing had been off .	76 2 1 42 1 20 164 24 10
Its profits , unlike Phibro 's , soared over the next two years , and had it held out , Salomon could have gotten an even bigger bundle .	6 1 2 85 0 1 2 34 38 6 0 0 1 2 13 165 23 60 35 2 1 4 163 21 6 36 0 1 10

Often the genteel , conservative , long-term-oriented investment bankers were displaced by crude traders : When angered , he cursed so forcefully that his face reddened and his pale-blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits , the authors say of Lehman 's Lewis Glucksman .	76 6 36 2 36 2 0 0 1 14 40 38 0 1 104 218 40 2 23 34 67 130 708 6 1 79 13 6 0 1 22 7 0 1 2 6 1 659 7 1 42 0 1 10
The earlier generation of our crowd bankers -- Belmonts , Warburgs , Lehmans , Baches and Schiffs -- had stressed above all probity , tradition , continuity and reputation .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 106 20 21 38 23 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 10
They were old-fashioned elegant gentlemen , who happened to be of German Jewish extraction .	23 11 0 0 1 2 33 64 18 87 7 0 0 1 10
But in the harsh world of today 's Wall Street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less scrupulous successors .	76 59 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 23 20 169 35 7 36 0 13 36 36 0 1 10
The cuckoo prefers the nests of other birds and heaves out their eggs .	6 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 13 11 35 6 1 10
But the old guard hired the New Crowd people : It brought in its own cuckoos .	76 6 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 104 23 11 35 6 0 1 10
So , as the Old Crowd toppled from the branch , it should n't have been too surprised .	76 2 39 6 0 1 34 38 6 1 2 23 4 35 163 164 29 24 10
The old guard had every right , however , to disdain the newcomers ' new ways of making money , such as greenmail .	6 0 1 11 6 1 2 35 2 18 19 6 1 42 0 1 93 32 1 2 69 12 1 10

Their other staple has been corporate takeovers , often hostile and financed by junk bonds .	6 0 1 20 21 0 1 2 29 24 13 40 38 0 1 10
Hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon .	0 1 11 52 6 0 1 10
Sometimes they are constructive , but often not .	76 23 28 24 2 263 76 771 10

Second , a long-term shareholder of a good company need n't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily : It will bounce back .	76 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 4 35 79 67 35 30 6 0 1 34 35 104 23 4 79 35 10
But if a raider takes over when the stock is weak , the shareholder never gets his recovery .	76 39 6 1 34 35 30 6 1 28 24 2 6 1 16 11 6 1 10
The raiders , meanwhile , have evolved their own pattern for spending their new millions .	6 1 2 16 2 20 21 6 0 1 93 32 6 0 1 10
As described in The New Crowd , they take on ambitious new wives , move to Greenwich , Conn. , or Bedford , N.Y. , buy OK pictures , and let their wives share the wealth with decorators .	218 40 38 6 0 1 2 23 11 35 0 0 1 2 34 38 1 2 1 2 13 1 2 1 2 11 0 1 2 13 282 6 1 19 6 1 38 1 10
Having donated heavily to museums , they demand a place on their boards .	315 169 35 7 1 2 23 11 6 1 12 6 1 10

However , on balance , the charity game helps America .	76 2 59 1 2 6 0 1 11 1 10

The Old Crowd is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this .	6 0 1 28 29 53 7 6 1 12 52 1 10
However , the phenomenon is not specifically Jewish .	76 2 6 1 28 29 29 24 10
It has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in , and that a few will cut corners in the process .	192 617 35 382 24 66 23 12 6 1 64 18 79 35 2 13 66 6 1 4 19 1 38 6 1 10

Some $ 170 million of the $ 233 million increase in nonperforming loans was related to real estate , and roughly three-quarters of that was in the troubled New England market , according to Richard Driscoll , vice chairman .	0 86 0 9 12 6 125 0 9 1 12 0 1 28 53 7 0 1 2 13 0 1 12 23 48 7 6 0 0 0 1 2 369 7 0 1 2 0 1 10

In August , soon after Wang Laboratories Inc. reported a staggering $ 424.3 million loss and replaced its president , two Boston sales representatives sent customers a letter saying : We fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the Amazing Comeback at Wang .	59 1 2 137 39 0 0 1 11 6 0 125 0 9 1 13 11 6 1 2 0 0 0 1 108 1 6 1 214 106 23 16 65 66 23 4 35 168 32 1 12 6 1 32 6 0 1 12 1 10
How soon Wang will stage a comeback , or if it will at all , are still matters of debate .	336 24 1 4 19 6 1 2 13 55 23 34 38 23 2 952 185 1 12 1 10
But Wang salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face : selling the products of a company that is on the ropes .	76 0 1 37 113 18 87 7 6 0 1 6 1 4 19 93 32 6 1 12 6 1 33 48 7 6 1 10
If your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you 're not feeling as if you 're backed up by a stable company , you 've lost it before you 've begun , says Mary Ann Cluggish , a Wellesley , Mass. , sales trainer and consultant who works with high technology companies .	39 6 1 37 32 1 81 0 1 13 23 37 35 120 203 293 23 14 40 35 38 6 0 1 2 23 20 21 23 30 23 20 60 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 36 2 0 2 0 1 13 1 33 34 38 0 0 1 10
It can happen in any industry .	23 4 79 38 6 1 10
Consider the difficulties faced by Audi salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration , or Exxon dealers ' problems in the wake of the Valdez oil spill .	19 6 1 40 38 0 1 30 6 1 14 40 38 0 1 12 0 1 2 13 0 1 42 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Like thousands of salespeople before them , Wang 's are finding ways to combat the bad news .	59 1 12 1 12 23 2 0 1 37 32 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
It 's very important that we exude confidence , even though within the family we know there 's a lot of hard work ahead , said Richard Miller , the Lowell , Mass. , computer concern 's new president , in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over .	192 383 29 24 66 23 11 1 2 67 30 59 6 1 23 44 50 51 6 1 12 0 1 78 2 56 0 1 2 6 36 2 0 2 0 1 42 0 1 2 153 6 0 1 12 1 6 1 910 23 34 35 10
Wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts .	1 34 38 0 1 70 7 0 1 13 36 0 0 1 10
Its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers .	6 0 1 13 0 1 20 139 1 7 0 0 1 10
Last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing , and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising .	137 76 23 11 6 0 1 38 0 1 2 13 23 11 0 1 30 1 34 35 102 13 120 10
After the company reported red ink for the fiscal third quarter , Wang 's marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as How could you not have known you were going to lose $ 55 million ? and Is Wang still a viable company ?	39 6 1 11 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 1 42 0 1 108 6 0 1 1 12 1 69 400 243 244 23 16 163 173 23 37 113 18 19 86 0 9 10 13 1317 1 185 6 0 1 10
Salespeople try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances .	1 64 18 19 6 1 13 11 1 12 1 10
Responding to such questions is defensive , says Kenneth Olissa , Wang 's vice president , marketing .	45 7 52 1 28 24 2 56 0 1 2 1 42 0 0 2 1 10
That 's antithetical to the art of selling .	23 28 53 7 6 1 12 1 10
Moreover , he notes that analyzing financial results poses a problem for a salesman who is n't particularly familiar with a balance sheet .	76 2 23 65 66 32 0 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 33 28 35 29 53 7 6 0 1 10

Mr. Miller vetoed that : Even I ca n't understand all the footnotes , he says .	0 1 11 23 104 1 123 4 35 19 52 6 1 2 23 27 10
Instead , he says , if the salespeople can get the customers to consider Wang 's products on their merits , he or a top financial officer will try to assuage the fears about finances .	76 2 23 44 2 39 6 1 4 134 6 1 18 5 1 42 1 7 6 1 2 23 13 6 0 0 1 4 154 18 19 6 1 12 1 10
Mike Metschan , a salesman in Wang 's Austin , Texas , office , has a breezier method : We tell them $ 3 billion companies do n't go out of business .	0 1 2 6 1 12 1 42 36 2 0 2 1 2 11 6 0 1 104 23 277 23 125 0 9 1 4 35 115 53 7 1 10
We tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties .	23 277 23 52 6 0 1 37 32 0 1 10
Numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines , but very few have had losses comparable to Wang 's or are carrying such a large debt load .	0 0 1 37 32 0 1 13 0 1 2 13 0 1 20 21 1 24 84 0 1 13 37 32 52 6 0 0 1 10

Although Wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 and the full fiscal year , Mr. Miller says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter .	39 1 4 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 40 8 9 13 6 0 0 1 2 0 1 44 23 44 6 1 4 79 38 1 38 6 0 1 10
Experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line .	1 12 0 1 44 23 32 6 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 10
If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will be a problem for the long run , says George Palmatier , a Minden , Nev. , sales consultant and author of The Marketing Edge .	39 6 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 12 1 2 23 4 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 36 2 0 2 0 1 13 1 12 6 0 1 10
Still , says John Sullivan , a management recruiter with Daniel Roberts Inc. of Boston , who has held senior sales positions at Polaroid and Atari : The customer will react to strength .	76 2 242 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 2 33 20 21 0 0 1 12 1 13 1 106 6 1 4 87 7 1 10

Show it 's business as usual .	215 23 11 1 158 24 10
That is n't easy .	23 28 35 24 10
Wang 's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable , wellrun companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come .	1 42 1 11 0 0 1 33 64 18 115 266 66 6 1 11 0 2 0 1 33 4 115 24 18 19 1 13 19 1 38 1 18 79 10
For buyers , these are career-risking decisions , says Jean Conlin , who supervises a network of Wang computers in the admissions department at Boston University .	59 1 2 23 11 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 33 11 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 10

Before the really bad news , we were looking at Wang fairly seriously , she says .	59 6 36 0 1 2 23 37 45 7 1 67 35 2 23 27 10

Wang 's overall product line is still not as good as other vendors , but they 've come a long way , says Steven Wendler , a consultant with market researcher Gartner Group , Stamford , Conn .	1 42 0 0 1 28 35 29 29 53 7 0 1 2 13 23 20 60 81 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 78 2 78 10

The first priority for Wang 's sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers .	6 0 1 85 1 42 0 1 64 18 538 24 23 48 161 7 0 1 10

But even before Wang 's latest financial troubles surfaced , some customers were trying to wall off their Wang installations so other departments would n't add Wang , says Chris Christiansen , a former Wang marketer who is now a market analyst with Meta Group , a market research firm in Stamford , Conn .	76 137 39 1 42 0 0 1 34 2 6 1 37 113 18 19 35 6 0 1 30 0 1 4 35 19 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 33 11 35 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10
One Wang salesman who left the company in July recalls that when he tried to sell products to Eastman Kodak , he worked to muster support from internal allies , but those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend .	0 0 1 33 11 6 1 38 1 65 66 39 23 64 18 5 1 7 0 1 2 23 64 18 19 1 12 0 1 2 13 6 1 28 24 30 23 11 6 1 10
The more recent losses were really devastating .	6 36 0 1 28 29 24 10

The financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing Wang 's image systems , which convert paper forms to electronic documents .	6 0 1 28 29 24 38 1 32 1 42 0 1 2 33 73 0 1 7 0 1 10
Consultants say that Wang 's technology is among the best available in the image market .	1 65 66 1 42 1 48 7 6 1 24 12 6 0 1 10
But salespeople often found that news of Wang 's problems superseded their sales efforts .	76 1 16 65 66 1 12 1 42 1 11 6 0 1 10
William Tait , a former sales manager in Indianapolis , says that his office had all but sold a $ 1.5 million image system to pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly & Co .	0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 65 66 6 1 20 72 16 139 6 125 0 9 0 1 7 0 0 0 0 0 1 10
When they were making the decision , all hell broke loose with the finances .	39 23 37 32 6 1 2 6 1 28 24 38 6 1 10
He says the Lilly executives told him they could n't take the risk with Wang .	23 44 6 0 1 277 23 23 4 35 5 6 1 7 1 10
Mr. Tait say he does n't blame Lilly .	0 1 215 23 4 35 19 1 10
Buyers have to rely on a supplier continually upgrading and replacing the product , he says .	1 64 18 87 49 6 1 16 32 13 32 6 1 2 23 27 10
When a company realizes that , it 's hard to go with Wang .	39 6 1 11 23 2 192 193 24 18 87 7 1 10
For Mr. Tait , who says he used to earn as much as $ 150,000 a year at Wang , it was one more reason to quit .	59 0 1 2 33 44 23 64 18 19 0 1 12 86 9 92 1 38 1 2 23 11 0 0 1 18 79 10

The reason does n't relate to your selling skills .	6 1 4 35 87 7 6 0 1 10
Discouragement feeds on itself .	1 48 7 23 10
The problem is , if people get down in the dumps , they stop selling , says Mike Durcan , a laid-off sales manager in Wang 's Austin office .	6 1 44 2 39 1 28 53 7 6 1 2 23 37 120 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 10

So , he advises , make goals achievable .	16 2 23 44 2 178 1 24 10

In addition to the increased reserve , the savings bank took a special charge of $ 5 million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters , and it posted a $ 7.6 million reduction in expected mortgage servicing fees , reflecting the fact that more borrowers are prepaying their mortgages .	59 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 32 0 13 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 2 13 23 11 6 125 0 9 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 32 6 80 66 0 1 37 32 6 1 10

On a day some United Airlines employees wanted Mr. Wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp , Messrs.

Deeply ingrained in both the book review Kissing Nature Good-bye by Stephen MacDonald -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept. 27 -RRB- and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity .	29 24 84 52 6 0 0 146 1 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 340 9 167 13 6 1 40 145 6 80 66 0 1 11 35 6 1 12 0 1 10

In addition , the tax-collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high-level positions to guide the 120,000-employee agency : a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system , which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world .	59 1 2 6 0 1 65 66 23 4 19 6 0 1 93 45 7 6 0 1 18 19 0 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 18 19 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 2 33 11 52 6 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 10

IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring accountability to the agency , which has an annual budget of more than $ 5 billion and collects about $ 1 trillion a year .	0 0 0 0 1 44 6 1 14 17 18 19 1 38 6 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 12 24 227 86 0 9 13 11 0 86 0 9 92 1 10
My assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget , Mr. Goldberg said .	6 1 13 23 42 1 65 66 23 4 35 19 6 1 12 1 33 282 23 16 13 16 19 13 19 6 1 2 0 1 27 10

Mr. Goldberg , who took over as head of the IRS in July , has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency , waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency .	0 1 2 33 48 35 7 1 12 6 1 38 1 2 20 151 40 38 119 23 108 6 1 2 1 13 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 10

I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which , in turn , I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue , he said .	23 65 66 23 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 138 2 59 1 2 23 232 4 87 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 23 27 10
The IRS hopes to fill the new positions soon .	6 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 35 10

Yet , while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades .	76 2 39 6 0 1 11 6 0 0 0 0 1 2 23 11 52 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 33 28 24 67 35 10
America 's war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship .	1 42 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 85 6 1 12 0 1 12 1 123 2 11 6 1 12 6 1 10
Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates .	39 0 0 1 64 35 18 19 1 2 23 4 19 23 70 7 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 12 1 13 1 10

In 1960 , for example , when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period .	59 1 2 59 1 2 39 0 1 11 52 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 13 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 23 14 40 38 0 1 57 16 32 13 16 32 6 1 2 70 7 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
The woman had nearly died .	6 1 20 16 60 10
But U.S. intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away .	76 0 1 2 72 1191 178 24 13 178 24 6 0 1 2 16 136 6 1 24 10

From that point on , the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian 's misadventures .	59 6 1 123 2 6 1 4 19 6 1 57 32 6 1 42 1 10
The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so resourceful .	6 1 20 21 13 16 169 7 0 1 2 13 1 29 29 24 10
The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of Iran , as well-born as Nicaragua 's Anastasio Somoza , as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti 's Baby Doc Duvalier .	6 0 0 1 28 35 29 53 7 6 1 12 1 2 29 53 7 1 42 0 1 2 29 53 7 0 1 12 6 1 13 29 53 7 1 42 0 0 1 10

And out of necessity : The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life .	270 369 7 1 104 6 1 4 19 1 13 16 154 18 5 23 7 1 2 13 6 0 1 12 6 1 1321 221 23 6 1 10

He has mastered the art of survival .	23 20 21 6 1 12 1 10
In keeping with America 's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega , recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival .	181 45 7 1 42 0 1 93 32 35 0 1 2 0 0 1 20 21 102 13 21 6 1 10
Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama 's dire economic situation , says Mr. Moss , but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement .	0 1 4 163 60 38 6 0 1 38 1 70 7 1 42 0 0 1 2 1322 0 1 2 13 0 0 1 20 35 114 23 0 1 12 1 2 13 6 1 12 6 0 1 10

Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne .	137 137 76 2 0 1 42 1 20 94 18 77 500 85 6 1 2 18 79 106 66 6 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 10

United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama 's national income .	0 1 11 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader .	32 6 1 11 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
Mr. Noriega 's initial retainer was only $ 50 to $ 100 a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX , a former intelligence official says .	0 1 42 0 1 11 0 86 9 132 86 9 92 1 2 13 0 1 12 1 13 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 27 10
It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly .	23 11 0 1 12 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 75 0 1 48 155 315 21 86 9 132 86 9 78 10
He did it very well , recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation .	23 11 23 67 35 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 33 11 0 1 13 6 1 10
He started building the files that helped him gain power .	23 37 32 6 1 33 282 23 19 1 10
A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy .	6 0 0 1 40 38 0 1 38 1 106 12 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 106 28 53 7 6 0 1 10
By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .	181 32 0 13 0 1 33 11 1 2 23 11 6 0 1 12 1 10
He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their mistresses .	23 162 442 0 1 20 151 763 120 35 2 129 20 151 40 38 6 1 10
This proved particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in 1967 , when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared could turn violent .	23 28 29 53 7 6 0 1 38 1 2 75 0 1 37 32 6 0 0 1 75 6 1 397 4 115 24 10
Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy .	0 1 20 174 66 6 0 0 1 37 45 7 6 1 12 6 1 10
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles , which was ruled by United Fruit Co .	76 23 11 6 1 38 1 138 23 73 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 14 40 38 0 0 1 10
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control .	6 1 24 1323 0 1 66 6 1 136 23 29 127 18 19 10
It was like a play on Broadway , recalls Mr. Martinez .	23 48 7 6 1 12 1 2 56 0 1 10
Noriega managed the whole thing .	1 11 6 0 1 10
He was superb .	23 28 24 10
Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people .	1 11 6 1 93 32 13 32 1 10
During his years in Chiriqui , however , Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious .	59 6 1 12 1 2 76 2 0 1 16 73 23 7 6 1 29 24 47 23 28 24 10
Rodrigo Miranda , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David , where he had his offices .	0 1 2 6 0 1 13 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 32 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 75 23 11 6 1 10
Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office .	0 1 4 134 23 78 18 19 35 6 1 13 79 38 6 1 35 2 45 7 23 13 16 120 38 6 1 10
People started wondering if something was wrong with him , Mr. Miranda recalls .	1 37 427 55 23 28 53 7 23 2 0 1 27 10
But through this period , so far as the U.S. military was concerned , Mr. Noriega was a model recruit .	76 59 6 1 2 137 76 694 6 0 1 14 40 2 0 1 11 6 0 1 10
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967 , according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret .	23 48 35 7 0 13 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 38 1 123 2 70 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 0 1 20 35 139 46 24 10
He flew to Fort Bragg , N.C. , in September of that year for a course in psychological operations , returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called military intelligence for officers .	23 34 38 0 1 2 1 2 38 1 12 6 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 120 38 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 38 6 0 1 15 0 1 12 1 10
Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty , but they did so falsely .	6 0 1 73 6 1 13 1 7 6 1 12 1 2 13 23 28 24 35 10
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama 's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier .	23 34 38 1 12 1 12 1 42 0 1 38 1 57 146 52 52 1 6 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 23 6 1 107 10
He became Gen. Torrijos 's inseparable shadow , and the holder of all Panama 's secrets .	23 11 0 1 42 0 1 2 13 6 1 12 6 1 42 1 10
When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega 's moonlighting , intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans .	39 0 1 48 7 6 1 38 0 1 42 1 2 0 1 16 65 66 6 1 48 161 7 6 1 10
Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States , recalls Francis J. McNeil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977 .	122 105 7 6 0 1 2 23 48 155 146 23 6 1 2 38 1 12 6 1 18 16 19 6 0 0 1 12 1 13 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 33 2 85 0 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 2 16 34 38 1 12 0 1 38 1 10
Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans .	23 12 23 162 55 6 0 1 4 5 0 0 1 7 6 1 30 23 28 29 29 53 7 6 1 10
Even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns .	137 59 6 0 1 2 1 11 0 1 10
During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers .	59 6 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 20 169 7 6 1 12 6 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 10
One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega , one of which was assassination .	0 0 1 11 35 6 1 12 0 1 93 45 7 0 1 2 23 12 361 11 1 10
The head of the DEA at the time , John Ingersoll , scotched the assassination plan .	6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 10
But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials , including Mr. Noriega .	76 23 4 79 38 1 18 19 0 1 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 12 0 1 10
Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S. .	0 1 16 65 66 0 1 28 43 18 87 7 6 1 12 6 1 10
Everybody was afraid of him , Mr. Ingersoll says .	23 28 53 7 23 2 0 1 27 10
Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976 , when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army 's 470th Military Intelligence Group .	0 1 11 6 36 0 1 38 1 2 75 0 0 1 65 66 23 20 121 111 1 12 36 0 1 7 0 1 45 7 6 0 1 42 0 0 0 1 10
The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos 's own phone , according to American intelligence officials .	6 1 11 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 2 70 7 0 0 1 10
We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar , says former CIA Director Stansfield Turner .	23 11 23 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 0 0 1 10
For the first time , the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , Mr. Turner says .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 37 111 0 1 7 6 0 1 106 13 6 1 28 24 2 0 1 27 10
In the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seedy characters .	59 6 1 12 1 2 39 23 64 18 19 1 2 23 73 23 7 0 1 10
The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you .	6 1 162 336 24 23 14 22 35 7 0 1 30 23 4 19 23 10
Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others .	0 1 85 6 1 162 55 0 1 73 0 1 12 6 1 7 6 1 13 1 10
Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration .	0 1 14 40 500 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
The U.S. soon found new cause for concern : gun-running .	6 1 16 11 0 1 12 1 12 1 10
Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza .	1 12 0 1 73 0 1 7 1 93 16 111 1 7 0 1 113 18 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
They included one of Mr. Noriega 's closest friends and business partners , Carlos Wittgreen .	23 11 1 12 0 1 42 0 0 13 0 1 2 0 1 10
And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. Noriega himself .	76 6 1 37 35 45 35 7 0 1 78 10
At the time , though , in 1979 , the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy .	59 6 1 2 76 2 59 1 2 6 1 37 67 35 45 7 6 0 0 0 1 10
Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon .	0 1 11 1 18 79 38 1 38 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 10
Dade County and federal authorities , learning that he intended to fly through Miami , made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil .	0 0 13 0 1 2 207 66 23 64 18 79 38 1 2 11 1 18 5 23 7 6 0 1 67 35 117 23 11 0 1 10
It was a Friday in June .	23 11 6 1 12 1 10
The Pentagon foiled the plan .	6 1 11 6 1 10
According to military officers at the time , word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting .	122 7 0 1 12 6 1 2 1 14 22 7 0 1 38 6 0 1 30 6 1 4 168 120 10
On Monday , U.S. officials received a routine , unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama .	59 1 2 0 1 73 6 36 2 0 1 7 6 0 0 1 12 1 10
Due to health reasons , Lt. Col. Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington , it read .	137 59 0 1 2 0 0 1 20 94 18 19 6 1 12 1 2 23 27 10
Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback .	1 12 1 11 52 6 1 10
Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen , the friend of Mr. Noriega , and the other four was dismissed on a technicality .	6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 14 22 7 6 1 10
But now , along with reindicting Mr. Noriega 's pal , they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself , on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $ 2 million in arms .	76 76 2 122 155 32 0 1 42 1 2 23 64 18 19 0 1 78 2 38 80 66 23 14 40 38 6 0 1 12 0 86 0 9 12 1 10
In January 1980 , Jerome Sanford , as assistant U.S. attorney , was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms in Miami .	59 1 123 2 0 1 2 85 0 0 1 2 14 22 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 78 22 7 6 1 12 1 2 1 13 1 12 1 10
Panamanian dictator Torrijos , he was told , had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington .	52 52 1 2 23 14 330 2 20 114 6 1 12 1 1 12 1 38 6 1 12 1 10
Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega 's friend , Mr. Wittgreen , would be handling the shah 's security .	0 1 14 330 0 1 42 1 2 0 1 2 4 168 32 6 1 42 1 10
After prodding from Mr. Sanford , U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed .	59 1 12 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 479 7 0 0 1 12 1 18 344 6 1 79 10
Unfortunately , Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter , those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control .	76 2 0 1 44 38 6 1 2 23 12 23 12 0 1 12 1 235 23 16 113 18 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 13 16 182 40 38 0 0 1 12 124 23 11 6 1 10
The letter , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death .	6 1 2 415 7 6 0 0 1 2 34 38 6 1 12 0 1 38 1 30 6 1 11 6 0 1 10
I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now , Mr. Sanford says .	23 44 39 23 20 151 17 18 79 35 76 23 4 35 19 6 1 23 11 35 2 0 1 27 10
If he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him .	39 23 20 151 152 24 2 23 4 163 21 23 10
In August 1983 , Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama , having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos .	59 1 123 2 0 1 48 35 7 1 13 0 1 12 1 2 315 21 6 1 38 6 1 36 0 1 209 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
Soon , the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses .	76 2 6 1 11 6 0 1 32 0 13 0 1 10
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega 's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll .	6 0 1 16 136 0 1 42 1 53 7 6 0 1 10
Payments averaged nearly $ 200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA .	1 11 0 86 9 92 1 38 6 0 0 0 1 13 6 1 10
Although working for U.S. intelligence , Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively .	181 45 7 0 1 2 0 1 37 16 32 6 1 35 10
During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas .	59 6 0 1 23 11 6 0 13 0 1 12 6 1 13 6 1 10
He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges .	23 16 34 38 1 42 0 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 70 7 0 1 2 6 1 33 16 48 7 0 1 13 33 34 38 6 0 0 1 12 1 33 4 35 5 6 1 7 0 1 10
But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House would n't act against him , recalls his close ally Jose Blandon , because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua .	76 0 1 14 330 6 0 0 1 4 35 87 7 23 2 56 6 0 0 0 1 2 30 23 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama .	0 1 44 6 1 82 6 1 18 19 35 6 0 0 1 38 1 10
Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua .	0 1 16 11 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
And on at least one occasion , in the spring of 1985 , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua .	76 59 305 148 0 1 2 59 6 1 12 1 2 23 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
Although , his help for the Contra cause was limited , it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration , says Sen. Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee .	39 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 14 40 2 23 28 43 18 221 23 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 33 16 34 38 6 0 0 1 10
Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin , he says .	1 11 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 38 6 1 2 23 27 10
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington -- by compromising U.S. officials .	6 1 12 1 11 0 0 1 12 124 0 1 4 163 21 52 1 12 1 106 93 32 0 1 10
Curtin Windsor , then the ambassador to Costa Rica , recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega 's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and quiet , serious conversation on the Aswara Peninsula .	0 1 2 52 6 1 12 0 1 2 37 182 22 7 1 38 0 1 42 0 0 1 38 6 1 12 0 0 1 13 0 2 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs , the U.S. ambassador to Panama , of the invitation .	0 1 73 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 2 7 6 1 10
Briggs screamed , Mr. Windsor recalls .	1 34 2 0 1 27 10
He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a honey trap , in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event with sound and video .	23 44 0 1 277 23 23 37 182 22 35 7 6 0 1 2 12 124 0 1 4 154 18 19 23 38 6 1 13 16 19 6 1 38 1 13 1 10
Mr. Briggs , on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council , could n't be reached for comment .	0 1 2 12 1 93 32 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 4 35 74 40 38 1 10
As Mr. Noriega 's political troubles grew , so did his offers of assistance to the Contras , an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington .	39 0 1 42 0 1 34 2 24 145 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 2 6 0 1 18 19 0 1 38 1 10
For instance , he helped steal the May 1984 Panamanian elections for the ruling party .	59 1 2 23 4 19 6 0 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
But just one month later , he also contributed $ 100,000 to a Contra leader , according to documents released for Oliver North 's criminal trial in Washington , D.C .	76 36 0 1 234 2 23 16 11 86 9 38 6 0 1 2 70 7 1 40 38 0 1 42 0 1 12 1 2 1 10

As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the North trial , Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in exchange for a promise to help clean up Noriega 's image and a commitment to lift the -LCB- U.S. . -RCB- ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces .	218 40 38 6 1 33 11 0 1 22 7 6 0 1 2 0 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 38 1 12 6 1 18 143 19 35 1 42 1 13 6 1 18 19 0 166 0 10 167 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10

Public protests against him were triggered in June 1987 due to charges by Diaz Herrera , his former chief of staff , that Mr. Noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs.

During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for his resignation , Mr. Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans , whom he had helped for so many years , could turn against him .	59 1 12 0 1 12 1 123 12 1 18 19 6 0 1 38 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 16 162 67 35 55 6 1 2 138 23 20 21 38 662 24 1 2 4 87 7 23 10

It is a knock-out battle -- perhaps to the death .	23 11 6 0 1 106 69 12 6 1 10
In the end , is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein 's monster , created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power ?	59 6 1 2 405 0 1 6 0 1 12 1 42 1 2 40 38 6 0 13 0 0 1 10

I do n't think we created him as much as we fed him , nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong .	23 4 35 215 23 11 23 67 35 117 23 11 23 2 11 23 13 282 23 154 35 18 115 24 13 24 10

The new reports of sluggishness , which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September , give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates .	6 0 1 12 1 2 33 14 40 38 6 0 0 0 1 75 0 1 34 38 1 38 1 2 108 6 1 6 1 18 16 19 6 1 12 1 13 19 0 1 10

A report in this week 's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also projects that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer , the leading cause of cancer death , should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate .	6 1 12 6 1 42 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 16 65 66 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 4 154 18 79 38 0 1 30 0 1 64 18 79 10
The report , which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking , is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer .	6 1 2 33 34 0 1 177 6 0 0 1 11 6 1 45 7 6 1 12 1 2 11 6 0 1 12 1 75 6 1 12 1 37 120 38 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , said Melvyn Tockman , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore .	828 23 37 32 65 66 6 0 1 42 1 37 32 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 13 0 1 12 1 10

The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % .	6 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 15 1 12 1 12 6 1 11 1 12 1 2 13 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 11 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 10
Measured the same way , the decline for black males was 14.2 % .	15 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 11 0 1 10

The study , by Susan Devesa , William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute 's staff , also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35-44 age bracket , except black men .	6 1 2 12 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 2 16 65 66 6 1 12 0 1 102 102 13 6 0 1 34 38 6 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 12 0 1 10
Although lung-cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole , the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year 2000 for women .	39 0 0 1 37 120 38 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 65 66 0 1 4 154 18 79 38 6 1 38 1 13 38 6 1 123 38 1 10

But Dr. Fraumeni , one of the authors of the report , said the declining rates we 're seeing for younger people we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future .	76 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 44 6 0 1 23 37 32 38 0 1 23 232 4 19 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 10
However , he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking .	76 2 23 65 66 6 1 34 38 6 0 1 12 1 10
Even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups , they ca n't be taken for granted , the report says .	137 39 6 0 1 12 0 1 11 6 0 13 0 1 2 23 4 35 74 22 46 24 2 6 1 27 10

An editorial in the NCI Journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality among young men and women in the U.S. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $ 2 billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking .	6 1 12 6 0 1 44 6 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 12 6 1 65 66 23 16 4 168 32 6 1 38 23 69 12 6 1 75 6 0 1 11 0 86 0 9 92 1 38 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10

Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior around the world , the editorial says , through the enactment of laws that limit advertising , boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education .	1 4 74 22 7 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 44 2 38 6 1 12 1 33 11 1 2 11 0 1 13 11 0 1 10

Consider , for example , the greenhouse effect and climate change ; numerous blue-ribbon scientific committees , including one from the National Academy of Science , judge there is a greater than 50 % probability of a grave problem in the offing .	79 2 38 1 2 6 0 1 13 0 1 91 0 0 0 1 2 12 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 990 50 51 6 24 447 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
The point was to answer the question in the conference title , not to try to create news stories for the event itself .	6 1 64 18 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 35 18 154 18 19 0 1 38 6 1 123 10

We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet 's atmosphere .	23 20 16 21 6 1 13 1 12 6 1 42 1 10

The problems of the environment are so interrelated , so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years .	6 1 12 6 1 28 289 24 2 289 29 53 7 6 0 1 12 1 13 289 24 66 192 226 24 23 4 115 43 18 19 23 35 30 0 1 14 40 38 24 25 0 1 10

The oil and auto industries , united in their dislike of President Bush 's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels , announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner-burning gasoline .	6 0 13 0 1 2 40 38 6 1 12 0 1 42 1 12 1 33 34 38 0 1 2 11 6 0 0 1 33 4 19 35 6 0 1 10
Officials of the Big Three auto makers and 14 petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most cost-effective fuel for reducing cities ' air-pollution problems , with no bias toward any fuel in particular .	1 12 6 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 44 23 37 113 35 18 19 6 36 0 1 93 32 1 42 0 1 2 38 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 10

Instead , the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline , which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas .	76 2 6 1 4 79 35 38 0 1 12 1 2 33 28 35 24 13 138 6 0 1 20 121 111 7 6 1 12 0 1 33 37 32 0 1 10

A second phase of research , which is still being planned , will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars .	6 0 1 12 1 2 33 37 35 182 40 2 4 19 0 1 38 0 0 1 78 182 40 38 1 12 0 13 0 1 10
There was no cost estimate for the second phase .	50 51 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers , said Keith McHenry , a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp .	6 0 1 123 44 6 0 13 0 1 11 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 10
And we are looking for the most cost-effective way to clean up the air .	76 23 37 45 7 6 36 0 1 18 19 35 6 1 10
But David Hawkins , an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council , said the research appears merely to be a way to promote reformulated gasoline .	76 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 44 6 1 64 35 18 19 6 1 18 19 0 1 10
Oil and auto companies supported a move on Capitol Hill last week to gut Mr. Bush 's plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative-fueled cars by 1995 .	0 13 0 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 69 78 18 19 0 1 42 1 18 134 0 1 18 168 32 0 1 38 1 10
Instead , a House subcommittee adopted a clean-fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative .	76 2 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 33 16 73 0 1 7 6 1 10
The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean-air bill .	6 0 1 20 173 23 4 154 18 19 6 1 30 6 0 1 13 0 1 11 35 6 0 0 1 10
William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said Lincoln Savings & Loan Association should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $ 2 billion .	0 1 2 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 44 0 0 0 0 1 4 163 151 40 38 6 1 38 1 18 19 1 75 23 397 4 221 1 366 24 7 86 0 9 10
Mr. Seidman , who has been the nation 's top bank regulator , inherited the problems of Lincoln , based in Irvine , Calif. , after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law .	0 1 2 33 20 21 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 11 6 1 12 1 2 40 38 1 2 1 2 30 6 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 0 0 1 10
He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry .	23 11 6 1 38 0 0 0 1 18 19 118 64 18 19 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr. , who is chairman of American Continental Corp. , Lincoln 's parent , and who contributed heavily to several U.S. senators .	6 1 16 4 19 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 33 11 1 12 0 0 1 2 1 42 1 2 13 33 48 35 7 0 0 1 10
Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell sick thrifts , has studied Lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986 .	0 1 308 6 1 66 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 40 18 19 0 1 2 20 21 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 120 70 7 1 10
My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions , we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations , Mr. Seidman said .	6 1 65 66 165 23 21 52 1 38 1 12 6 0 1 2 23 4 163 21 6 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
When Lincoln was seized by the government , for example , 15 % of its loans , or $ 250 million , were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental 's 50 other subsidiaries , according to Mr. Seidman .	39 1 14 40 38 6 1 2 59 1 2 0 1 12 6 1 2 13 86 0 9 2 48 7 1 33 37 111 0 1 7 1 12 0 1 42 0 0 1 2 70 7 0 1 10
But the government did n't step in until six months ago , when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors .	76 6 1 4 35 115 24 38 0 1 1326 2 55 0 1 73 1 7 1 12 6 1 75 0 1 48 7 0 0 0 1 12 1 10
The bankruptcy filing , the government has charged in a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit , was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company , which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals .	6 0 1 2 6 1 20 173 38 6 125 0 9 0 1 2 11 1 12 6 1 18 5 0 1 7 6 0 1 2 33 73 6 1 7 6 1 12 0 1 10
The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court .	6 1 33 20 151 22 7 0 1 48 35 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
I think it 's fairly clear -LCB- Mr. Keating -RCB- knew , that regulators were set to seize Lincoln , Mr. Seidman said .	23 44 192 226 29 24 166 0 1 167 65 2 66 1 14 17 18 19 1 2 0 1 27 10
Further investigation , he said , may result in further actions against Lincoln 's executives , said Mr. Seidman , including fraud actions .	0 1 2 23 44 2 4 87 7 0 1 12 1 42 1 2 56 0 1 2 12 0 1 10
Mr. Keating , for his part , has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift .	0 1 2 85 6 1 2 20 21 1 207 66 1 16 11 6 1 10
Leonard Bickwit , an attorney in Washington for Mr. Keating , declined to comment on the hearings , except to say , We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time .	0 1 2 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 2 64 18 87 7 6 1 2 500 18 215 2 23 4 168 45 35 38 0 1 7 23 12 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
Lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators , in an agency disbanded by the new law , has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. Keating .	1 42 1 12 0 0 1 2 12 6 1 40 38 6 0 1 2 20 164 53 7 0 1 33 73 1 12 1 12 0 1 7 0 1 10
Mr. Seidman said yesterday , for example , that Sen. Dennis DeConcini -LRB- D. , Ariz. -RRB- , who received $ 48,100 in contributions from Mr. Keating , phoned Mr. Seidman to request that he push for a sale of Lincoln before it would be seized .	0 1 65 35 2 38 1 2 66 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 2 33 73 86 9 12 1 7 0 1 2 11 0 1 18 77 66 23 48 7 6 1 12 1 75 23 4 74 40 10
After the government lawsuit was filed against Lincoln , Sen. DeConcini returned the campaign contributions .	39 6 0 1 14 22 7 1 2 0 1 11 6 0 1 10
The senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because hundreds of Arizona jobs -LCB- at Lincoln -RCB- were on the line .	6 1 42 1 65 35 66 23 48 7 6 1 12 1 30 1 12 0 1 166 12 1 167 48 7 6 1 10
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle -LRB- D. , Mich . -RRB- has also returned contributions he received from Mr. Keating a year ago .	0 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 20 35 21 1 23 73 7 0 1 6 1 26 10
Sens. John Glenn -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- , John McCain , -LRB- R. , Ariz. -RRB- and Alan Cranston -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln .	0 0 0 253 1 2 1 167 2 0 0 2 253 1 2 1 167 13 0 1 217 1 2 1 167 16 73 0 1 7 0 1 13 64 18 79 38 1 12 1 10
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- said Sen. Cranston volunteered to appear before the House committee , if necessary .	0 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 44 0 1 64 18 194 38 6 0 1 2 1028 24 10
But a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators .	76 6 0 0 1 44 6 1 28 43 18 19 35 6 1 12 6 1 10
At the hearing , Mr. Seidman said the RTC has already pumped $ 729 million into Lincoln for liquidity .	59 6 1 2 0 1 44 6 1 20 35 21 86 0 9 38 1 38 1 10
He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $ 225 million in American Continental subordinated debt .	23 16 11 35 0 1 12 1 12 1 12 86 0 9 12 0 0 0 1 10
Some of those debtholders have filed a suit , saying they believed they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit .	23 12 6 1 20 21 6 1 2 214 23 44 23 37 32 0 1 12 1 10
We have no plans at this time to pay off those notes , he said .	23 11 6 1 38 6 1 18 19 35 6 1 2 23 27 10
Eastern Airlines ' creditors committee , unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings , asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization .	0 1 42 0 1 2 24 84 6 1 42 1 93 45 7 0 1 2 82 6 0 1 18 19 0 1 12 6 1 10
Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman , Sachs & Co. , hired by creditors to consult on Eastern 's financial plans , told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval .	1 12 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 0 2 0 0 1 2 17 38 1 18 79 38 1 42 0 1 2 308 6 1 38 6 0 1 35 66 1 42 0 1 18 87 7 0 1 28 29 24 84 6 1 123 33 11 6 1 42 1 10
According to one person present at the meeting , Eastern 's new plan is financially overly optimistic .	122 7 0 1 24 84 6 1 2 1 42 0 1 28 29 29 24 10
Asked about the consultants ' reports , an Eastern spokeswoman said we totally disagree .	40 38 6 1 42 1 2 6 0 1 44 23 16 34 10
She said they have oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base .	23 44 23 20 60 13 21 6 0 1 33 136 6 1 29 24 10
At a later news conference here , Frank Lorenzo , chairman of Eastern 's parent Texas Air Corp. , said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year , operating with more service than it originally had scheduled .	59 6 0 0 1 123 2 0 1 2 1 12 1 42 0 0 0 1 2 44 1 37 32 6 1 93 156 53 7 1 13 44 23 4 87 7 0 0 1 12 1 67 67 35 2 120 38 0 1 75 23 16 20 60 10
He insisted , as he has before , that creditors would be paid in full under the plan .	23 65 2 30 23 34 35 2 66 1 4 74 40 140 24 38 6 1 10
Mr. Lorenzo made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan .	0 1 11 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 12 6 1 10
We 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly , Mr. Lorenzo told reporters .	23 48 7 6 1 93 32 6 0 1 38 6 1 13 37 32 6 0 1 35 2 0 1 381 1 10
We 're meeting and surpassing our goals , he added .	23 37 32 13 32 6 1 2 23 27 10
In July , Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size .	59 1 2 1 13 6 1 48 7 6 0 1 33 592 198 1 18 19 86 0 9 12 1 13 18 87 7 0 1 38 52 6 0 1 10
But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle , its Philadelphia hub and various planes , Eastern hit a stumbling block .	76 181 32 35 1 69 12 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 13 0 1 2 1 11 6 0 1 10
It could n't sell its South American routes , one of the major assets marked for disposal .	23 4 35 19 6 0 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 22 7 1 10
Those routes , valued by the creditors ' professionals at about $ 400 million , were to be sold to AMR Corp. 's American Airlines .	6 1 2 22 38 6 1 42 1 7 0 86 0 9 2 64 18 74 22 7 0 1 42 0 1 10
A last-minute snag in negotiations with AMR , over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit , caused the deal to collapse .	6 0 1 12 1 12 1 2 12 6 0 1 12 1 13 6 0 0 1 2 82 6 1 18 79 10
Eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself , which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization .	1 16 44 23 4 154 18 19 13 19 6 1 35 2 90 4 19 23 38 0 1 12 6 1 10
It also would leave Eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan .	23 16 4 221 1 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 40 38 6 0 1 10
Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped .	6 1 12 6 1 44 6 0 1 16 22 7 1 4 154 18 74 40 10
Since then , Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions , but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions .	59 1 2 1 20 121 45 7 1 38 1 2 13 6 0 1 20 121 32 1 12 6 1 10
The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern 's plans .	6 1 11 0 1 12 1 23 479 7 18 19 1 42 1 10
Both said the new plan would n't work .	23 44 6 0 1 4 35 79 10
Ernst & Young said Eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest , tax and depreciation by $ 100 million , and that Eastern 's plan presented no comfort level , according to a source present at yesterday 's session .	0 0 1 44 1 42 1 4 5 6 1 12 1 12 1 2 1 13 1 7 86 0 9 2 13 66 1 42 1 11 6 0 1 2 1327 7 6 1 24 84 1 42 1 10
Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by $ 120 million to $ 135 million , the source said .	1 12 0 1 44 1 4 5 6 0 1 7 86 0 9 132 86 0 9 2 6 1 27 10
The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated .	6 1 44 23 44 1 4 154 18 19 0 1 18 19 6 1 2 13 66 23 4 19 36 0 1 269 40 10
Other costs also would increase , including maintenance , because Eastern has an older fleet .	0 1 16 4 79 2 38 1 2 30 1 11 6 0 1 10
At the news conference , Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment .	59 6 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 0 0 1 11 6 0 210 1 10
Flanked by flight attendants , pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms , they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats .	40 38 0 1 2 1 13 0 1 22 7 0 0 0 1 2 23 44 1 20 21 6 0 1 13 37 32 6 1 10
Starting next month , Eastern will begin flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700 , they said .	120 67 35 2 1 4 168 32 0 1 35 70 7 6 0 1 123 2 23 27 10
Mr. Bakes declined to give out Eastern 's daily losses , but said he did n't expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow .	0 1 64 18 535 24 1 42 0 1 2 13 44 23 4 35 215 1 4 154 18 87 7 6 1 12 0 1 16 40 38 1 10
These accounts hold several hundred million dollars , primarily from asset sales .	6 1 11 0 0 0 1 2 69 12 0 1 10
The plan Eastern hopes to pursue , he said , calls for Eastern to have $ 390 million in cash by year 's end .	6 1 1 64 18 19 2 23 44 2 592 198 1 18 19 86 0 9 12 1 38 1 42 1 10
Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January .	52 1 13 0 1 44 6 1 4 74 40 38 1 10
As to negotiations with creditors , Mr. Lorenzo said in remarks after the conference we 'll have to see how they -LCB- talks -RCB- come along .	122 7 1 12 1 2 0 1 44 38 1 12 6 1 23 4 154 18 194 55 23 12 1 167 34 35 10
However , he added , it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors .	76 2 23 44 2 192 1328 35 6 1 299 6 1 74 40 38 1 10
It must be accepted by the court .	23 4 74 40 38 6 1 10
Under bankruptcy law , Eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan .	59 0 1 2 1 11 0 1 12 6 0 1 18 19 6 0 0 1 10
That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again .	6 1 20 151 40 35 13 4 74 40 35 10
If Eastern can get creditor support , court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift .	39 1 4 19 0 1 2 0 1 12 6 1 4 115 29 24 10
But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan , or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own .	76 1 28 43 18 87 7 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 13 6 1 4 19 6 1 13 19 6 1 10
In any event , some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes .	59 6 1 2 6 1 24 84 6 1 162 55 6 1 4 79 38 1 223 40 38 0 1 13 0 1 10
Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4 .	1 11 0 1 6 0 1 177 6 0 1 34 8 9 10
Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85 % to 90 % of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern .	0 1 277 1 6 1 1 37 32 4 19 6 1 69 78 807 69 78 112 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring , only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of 1,050 a day .	23 44 23 4 168 32 36 0 1 92 1 12 0 1 2 29 29 24 84 6 1 42 0 1 12 1 92 1 10
HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before 1990 are weakening .	1 93 32 6 0 0 1 38 1 37 120 10
The method of calculating the 20 % tax , paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way , is due for a change in 1990 , thanks to 1986 's tax act .	6 1 93 32 6 36 0 1 2 40 30 23 11 1 40 81 0 1 2 28 53 7 6 1 38 1 2 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
But most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity ; they have been trying to head it off this year .	76 0 1 65 66 6 1 33 64 18 74 40 436 24 0 1 91 23 20 121 113 18 19 23 35 81 1 10
Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski backed a simplification plan in the pending House tax bill , but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser .	0 13 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 13 6 1 64 35 18 19 6 0 0 1 10
Now the Senate 's stripped-down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax .	76 6 1 42 0 1 11 6 1 18 87 7 6 0 1 10

Even the U.S. Forest Service , whose lenient multiple-use philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the U.S. , has begun to close some lands to the bikes , including major portions of the popular Pacific Crest Trail , which stretches from California to Canada .	52 6 0 0 1 2 135 0 0 1 11 0 1 38 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 20 94 18 5 6 1 7 6 1 2 38 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 33 34 38 1 38 1 10

Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans .	1 20 164 24 57 32 6 1 12 6 0 1 10

Yet Sierra 's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization , which estimates that 17 % of its 500,000 members own mountain bikes .	76 1 42 0 1 20 21 23 12 6 1 38 6 1 2 33 65 66 0 1 12 6 0 1 11 0 1 10
Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric ; it no longer , for example , lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain-marring off-road vehicles .	1 12 6 1 82 6 1 35 18 19 6 0 1 91 23 72 16 2 85 1 2 73 6 1 7 6 0 1 12 1 13 0 0 0 1 10

The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the opposition , which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills .	6 1 20 60 13 60 2 13 0 1 11 23 70 7 6 0 1 2 13 23 20 328 19 6 1 2 33 72 16 11 1 12 0 0 0 1 10

In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a school , the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government .	59 6 1 75 6 1 14 17 18 19 6 1 2 6 1 2 13 161 7 6 1 2 6 0 1 20 21 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 10

The station is promised $ 1.8 billion within the $ 5.36 billion provided for research and development in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , and the nation 's high-speed aerospace plane -- cut by the Senate -- could receive as much as $ 60 million in new funds or transfers .	6 1 14 15 86 0 9 12 6 86 0 9 22 7 1 13 1 38 6 0 1 13 0 1 2 13 6 1 42 0 0 1 196 40 38 6 1 106 4 19 366 24 7 86 0 9 12 0 1 13 1 10
Similarly , the House agreed to add back $ 62 million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite , being developed by General Electric Co .	76 2 6 1 64 18 535 24 86 0 9 18 19 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 182 40 38 0 0 1 10
And while setting a statutory limit of $ 1.6 billion on the automated space probe , the conference appropriated $ 30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission , a successor to the Voyager space probe .	76 181 32 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 12 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 11 86 0 9 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Among major domestic agencies , the Environmental Protection Agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration , with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14 % to about $ 829.9 million .	59 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 64 18 19 1 69 12 23 40 38 6 1 2 31 0 0 13 0 1 120 38 0 1 38 0 86 0 9 10
An estimated $ 1.57 billion is separately allocated for the National Science Foundation , and within the Housing and Urban Development Department , more than $ 9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing , including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families .	6 0 86 0 9 14 35 22 7 6 0 0 1 2 13 59 6 1 13 0 0 1 2 24 227 86 0 9 14 22 7 36 0 1 2 12 6 0 1 18 19 0 0 1 33 11 6 0 1 10
To an unusual degree , the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states .	59 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 20 21 6 1 100 1 18 5 1 7 1 12 0 1 10
While the practice was discouraged in the past , the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals , environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities .	39 6 1 14 40 38 6 1 2 6 0 1 14 22 7 1 42 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 22 7 0 1 10
The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds , where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $ 20 million , and the conference added 15 more valued at $ 8 million to ostensibly preserve balance between the House and Senate .	6 36 0 1 16 4 163 169 7 0 0 1 2 75 6 0 1 20 35 21 6 1 12 0 1 22 7 86 0 9 2 13 6 1 11 1 123 22 7 86 0 9 18 16 19 1 12 6 1 13 1 10
Yesterday 's conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week , as appropriators approved a fiscal 1990 transportation bill late Monday that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights .	1 42 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 18 87 7 1 81 1 2 30 1 308 6 0 0 0 1 67 35 702 11 6 0 1 93 120 38 0 0 0 1 10
An exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to Hawaii and Alaska , but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about 30 flights would be covered .	6 1 4 79 38 1 24 84 0 1 12 1 13 1 2 13 1 12 6 0 1 78 44 6 13 52 6 1 4 74 40 10
Separately , a third conference report covering an $ 18.4 billion Treasury and Postal Service bill was sent to the Senate after passing the House on a 383-30 roll call yesterday .	76 2 6 0 0 1 32 6 125 0 9 0 13 0 0 1 14 22 7 6 1 57 32 6 1 38 6 0 0 1 35 10

Defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint .	1 13 0 1 11 6 0 36 0 1 120 38 6 1 42 1 10
And among domestic programs , the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services .	76 59 0 1 2 6 36 0 1 11 0 0 1 12 0 1 22 7 0 1 32 6 1 12 1 13 1 12 1 13 0 1 10
The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate , and Mr. Bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate-passed provisions renewing U.S. support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities .	6 0 1 64 18 79 35 38 6 0 0 1 2 13 0 1 16 37 113 18 19 6 1 33 11 0 1 32 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
In a sharply written letter , Rep. David Obey , chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations , warned Mr. Bush that the result of his ultimatum could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere .	59 6 36 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 308 0 1 66 6 1 12 6 1 4 19 1 18 19 6 1 35 10
As a result of your ultimatum , writes the Wisconsin Democrat , I guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference , inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill .	59 6 1 12 6 1 2 56 6 0 1 2 23 44 50 1337 67 35 6 1 93 111 0 1 7 1 38 0 1 12 1 2 76 122 7 6 1 23 16 64 18 19 6 1 10
Markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge .	1 16 14 40 30 23 34 13 34 10
Gold , which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time , yesterday achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness : The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market .	1 2 33 20 35 60 13 60 35 38 52 6 1 2 16 277 118 4 19 6 0 1 12 1 106 6 36 36 0 0 1 28 24 38 0 1 12 52 0 1 13 0 0 1 10

According to one analyst , Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber , New York , the stock market 's ability on Monday to rally from last Friday 's decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either -- took the starch out of precious metals prices , and out of gold 's , in particular .	122 7 0 1 2 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 1 42 1 12 1 18 79 38 0 1 42 1 106 33 64 18 77 66 6 1 37 35 113 18 79 35 106 136 6 1 53 7 0 0 1 2 13 365 7 0 1 2 7 1 10
Yesterday , gold traded within a narrow range .	76 2 1 34 38 6 0 1 10
Gold tried to rally on Monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year : selling by gold producers , who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold .	1 64 18 79 38 1 13 34 38 6 0 1 33 20 21 0 1 38 24 41 6 1 93 120 38 0 1 2 33 64 18 19 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
December delivery gold is trading in a range of $ 365 to $ 375 -LCB- an ounce -RCB- and is having difficulty breaking out above that , Mr. Savaiko said .	0 0 1 37 120 38 6 1 12 86 9 132 86 9 166 92 1 167 13 37 32 1 120 35 38 23 2 0 1 27 10
Producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold .	1 85 6 1 108 6 1 6 0 1 12 754 18 19 1 10
Also , Mr. Savaiko noted , stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive .	76 2 0 1 44 2 0 0 1 32 0 1 37 120 57 32 1 69 12 0 1 30 23 37 120 67 38 6 0 1 33 4 35 178 1 13 0 1 24 10
Jeffrey Nichols , president of APMS Canada , Toronto precious metals advisers , said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal .	0 1 2 1 12 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 44 50 51 1 18 134 0 1 18 19 6 1 10
Investors in the U.S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the -LCB- Federal Reserve -RCB- in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system , which helped the stock market rebound on Monday , he said .	1 12 6 1 13 1 28 53 7 6 1 12 0 166 0 1 167 12 6 1 18 5 1 7 0 1 2 90 44 6 0 1 34 38 1 2 23 27 10
There is n't any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold , he said .	50 51 35 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 18 19 1 2 23 27 10
They still bear the memory of October 1987 , when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell , Mr. Nichols said .	23 16 11 6 1 12 1 123 2 75 23 11 1 30 6 0 1 34 13 37 35 32 1 30 0 1 16 34 2 0 1 27 10
It 's an experience they do n't want to repeat .	23 11 6 1 23 4 35 154 18 19 10
At the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation , he said , and as for the dollar , gold 's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold .	59 6 1 0 1 14 35 22 7 1 2 23 44 2 13 122 7 6 1 2 1 42 1 12 6 1 20 121 120 35 104 1 12 6 1 37 35 32 0 1 12 1 10
Dinsa Mehta , chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank , said : There is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its flight to safety quality .	0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 44 106 50 51 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 18 19 1 30 6 0 1 4 115 24 13 1 4 19 23 12 6 0 71 1 1 10
There is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher , it may be just a false alarm .	50 51 0 1 18 19 1 30 39 6 0 1 28 24 2 23 4 19 52 6 0 1 10
This is keeping the gold traders handcuffed .	23 37 327 6 0 1 24 10
The most remarkable feature about yesterday 's action was that the price of roughly $ 370 an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold , Mr. Mehta said .	6 36 0 1 12 1 42 1 65 66 6 1 12 0 86 9 92 1 14 22 46 401 171 7 0 1 12 6 1 18 16 19 1 2 0 1 27 10
I do n't know what it means over the long run , but for the short term , it appears that gold producers are grateful for the $ 10 or so that gold has risen over the past week or so , he said .	23 4 35 19 119 23 11 38 6 0 1 2 13 59 6 0 1 2 23 65 66 0 1 28 53 7 6 86 9 69 78 75 1 20 60 38 6 0 1 13 1 2 23 27 10
Previously , he noted , gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market , letting prices rise as much as possible before selling .	76 2 23 44 2 0 1 64 18 87 35 7 6 0 0 1 2 278 1 19 0 1 158 24 57 120 10
Mr. Mehta observed that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit , which rose sharply in August , according to yesterday 's report , has been having less and less impact on the gold market .	0 1 65 66 6 0 0 0 1 2 33 34 35 38 1 2 415 7 1 42 1 2 20 121 32 0 13 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The dollar has n't reacted much to it , so gold has n't either , he said .	6 1 20 35 169 35 7 23 2 185 1 34 35 35 2 23 27 10

The March contract advanced 0.14 cent a pound to 14.11 cents .	6 0 1 34 67 35 294 1 38 0 1 10
According to an analyst , Cuba ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked Japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year , into early next year .	122 7 6 1 2 1 4 35 19 52 6 0 1 13 20 195 1 18 19 6 1 12 1 40 38 52 6 1 2 12 0 0 1 10
Japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar , the analyst said .	1 14 22 7 6 0 1 33 4 79 70 7 6 0 1 13 19 6 1 2 6 1 27 10
It was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices , the analyst said .	23 11 6 1 12 6 1 33 4 19 1 2 6 1 27 10
Another analyst noted that Cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years .	6 1 65 66 1 20 121 32 1 38 0 1 10
To the professionals in the trade it did n't cause much surprise .	59 6 1 12 6 1 23 4 35 19 0 1 10

LIVESTOCK AND MEATS :	1 13 1 106
The prices of cattle , hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending , which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork .	6 1 12 0 2 0 13 0 0 0 1 34 30 0 1 11 35 80 66 6 0 0 0 1 4 19 0 1 2 33 85 1 4 19 0 1 12 1 13 1 10

The prices of most soybean and soybean-meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying from the U.S. or South America about 250,000 metric tons of soybeans and as many as 400,000 metric tons of soybean meal .	6 1 12 0 0 13 0 0 1 34 38 80 66 6 0 1 14 22 155 606 7 6 1 13 0 1 36 0 0 1 12 1 13 751 24 7 1 0 1 12 0 1 10

Eight months after Gen.

Meanwhile , the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics .	76 2 6 0 1 28 29 53 155 111 6 1 7 0 1 10
In this they are aided by years of American , European , Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public .	59 23 23 14 40 38 1 12 0 2 0 2 0 13 0 1 12 6 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 135 1 11 1 12 6 0 1 10
This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better , moderate leaders .	6 0 0 1 12 6 1 20 21 0 2 0 1 10
In autumn last year , for example , the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates .	59 1 137 76 2 59 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 28 43 18 5 6 1 7 0 1 10
At the last minute , however , Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar , perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists , with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces .	59 6 0 1 2 76 2 0 1 11 35 0 1 2 52 6 0 1 13 1 12 6 1 2 38 6 485 299 6 1 74 22 7 6 1 10
The deal fell through , and Kandahar remains a major regime base .	6 1 28 24 2 13 1 11 6 0 0 1 10
The resistance lacks not only air power , armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves .	6 1 11 52 52 0 1 2 1 13 1 13 52 52 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 13 52 0 1 10
Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime .	0 0 1 64 18 134 0 1 13 0 1 18 19 35 6 1 10
Instead , they were pressured by Pakistan 's ISI , the channel for their support , into attacking Jalalabad .	76 2 23 14 22 38 1 42 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 2 155 32 1 10
They took more than 25 % casualties ; journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors .	23 11 24 447 36 0 1 91 1 65 66 23 11 1 38 0 1 10
The wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the Kabul regime , but that it continues to exist and fight at all .	6 1 65 76 66 6 1 20 94 18 19 6 0 1 2 13 66 23 64 18 79 13 79 38 23 10
Last summer , in response to congressional criticism , the State Department and the CIA said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off ; but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive .	137 76 2 59 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 13 6 1 44 23 20 21 0 1 12 6 1 1 177 23 14 40 35 91 13 192 331 35 24 442 1 37 182 40 13 55 23 4 79 10
For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack .	59 1 6 1 20 164 53 7 0 1 10
Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons .	137 76 50 51 6 80 66 23 20 151 22 7 1 13 0 0 1 10
Indeed , U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year .	76 2 0 1 20 174 38 6 1 66 6 1 12 1 48 7 416 1 6 0 1 11 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful .	1 13 1 4 163 170 6 1 24 10
For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent , based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf .	59 6 1 0 1 20 164 24 2 70 7 1 13 6 1 12 0 13 0 1 10
No settlement negotiated by others can force the Afghan people to give up their struggle .	6 1 40 38 1 4 134 6 0 1 18 19 35 6 1 10
A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain .	6 1 12 0 0 1 4 16 134 23 18 79 38 1 10
Creation of a new , realistic U.S. policy is long overdue .	1 12 6 0 2 0 0 1 28 29 24 10
Ms. Klass , editor and co-author of Afghanistan : The Great Game Revisited -LRB- Freedom House -RRB- , directs the Freedom House program on Afghanistan\/Southwest Asia .	0 1 2 1 13 1 12 1 12 0 0 1 40 12 0 1 167 2 11 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid Nicaragua 's Contra rebels , or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles .	23 11 6 1 12 0 1 13 6 1 67 70 7 6 1 18 19 1 42 0 1 2 13 6 1 93 32 6 0 0 1 18 19 35 0 0 1 10
Yet under Mr. Reagan 's preferred successor , President Bush , those two cherished national-security causes are withering on the vine .	76 59 0 1 42 0 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 37 120 38 6 1 10
And , surprisingly , little more than a whimper of protest is being heard , even though Reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative .	76 2 76 2 1 123 12 6 1 12 1 37 182 40 2 67 30 1 16 11 1 32 6 1 13 6 0 0 1 10
The programs have arthritis , says Rep. Henry Hyde , a conservative Republican from Illinois .	6 1 11 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 10
Yet , he asserts , you look around ... and you say , Who are the leaders ?	76 2 23 34 2 23 28 24 106 13 23 586 2 246 11 6 1 10
Who is going to carry the water ?	246 37 113 18 19 6 1 10
It is n't surprising that President Bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI .	192 383 35 24 66 0 1 20 35 21 6 1 18 19 35 6 1 13 1 10
Though he nominally supports both programs , Mr. Bush has n't been a passionate champion of either cause , as Mr. Reagan was .	39 23 16 11 6 1 2 0 1 20 35 21 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 30 0 1 34 10
What 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list .	118 28 24 65 66 50 51 35 1 12 6 0 1 30 6 0 1 282 6 1 87 7 6 0 1 10
A combination of factors -- a weariness among some conservatives , a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility .	6 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 1 12 0 1 106 64 18 19 6 0 1 10
Above all , though , conservative Republicans who have championed both the Contras and SDI are reluctant to attack a Republican president for failing to do more -- though that reluctance may be receding .	76 105 2 76 2 0 1 33 20 21 52 0 1 13 1 28 43 18 19 6 0 1 57 113 18 19 1 203 293 6 1 4 168 120 10
We want to complain , we want to say something about it , and we 're going to as it gets worse , says Rep. Dan Burton , an Indiana Republican who has been a staunch Contra backer .	23 64 18 79 2 23 64 18 19 23 12 23 2 13 23 37 113 236 30 23 28 24 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 33 20 21 6 0 0 1 10
But it 's like kicking your father in the pants .	76 23 48 155 32 6 1 38 6 1 10
You hate to do it because he 's your father .	23 64 18 19 23 30 23 11 6 1 10
Mr. Burton says conservatives ' unhappiness with Mr. Bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out .	0 1 44 1 42 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 4 178 23 29 43 18 79 35 10
Of course , neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI .	59 1 2 52 0 1 13 0 1 20 35 21 6 1 13 1 10
Mr. Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February .	0 1 20 21 6 1 38 0 1 18 5 0 1 7 6 1 30 1 11 0 1 67 35 10
But the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels .	76 6 1 20 21 6 1 18 19 0 1 38 6 1 10
And the administration 's deal with Congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month , though the committees are likely to let aid continue until February .	76 6 1 42 1 12 1 108 0 0 1 6 1 18 19 35 0 0 1 67 35 2 30 6 1 28 43 18 344 1 79 38 1 10
Most analysts think there 's little prospect the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U.S. arms , and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best .	0 1 44 50 51 0 255 6 1 4 19 6 0 0 1 38 0 1 2 13 59 6 0 1 6 1 12 6 1 4 115 24 67 35 10
Instead of focusing on the Contras , Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress -- most recently in a White House meeting yesterday -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua 's Sandinista government .	122 155 120 38 6 1 2 0 1 20 169 155 229 1 12 1 140 29 24 84 6 0 0 1 1025 106 18 19 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
The administration continues to support SDI , or Star Wars , and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program .	6 1 64 18 19 1 2 13 0 1 2 13 23 16 64 18 134 6 1 18 19 23 12 6 1 23 64 18 5 7 6 1 10
And just last week , Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave a strong speech listing compelling reasons to push ahead with SDI and saying he 'd urge President Bush to veto a defense bill with inadequate funding for the program .	76 137 137 76 2 0 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 32 0 1 18 79 35 38 1 13 214 23 4 134 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 10
But the strong pitch by Mr. Cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to SDI .	76 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 115 355 24 29 24 18 19 1 12 1 10
The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding , and in the end the program 's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year .	6 1 20 35 169 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 13 59 6 1 6 1 42 1 4 115 29 43 18 19 35 6 1 12 1 67 35 10
And while the defense secretary is speaking out , President Bush himself has n't launched any high-visibility campaign to drum up support , as President Reagan did .	76 39 6 0 1 37 120 35 2 0 1 123 20 35 21 6 0 1 18 19 35 1 2 30 0 1 34 10
The administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing Mr. Reagan 's original vision of an impenetrable shield protecting the whole U.S. , but rather a more modest version .	6 1 16 65 66 23 37 35 32 0 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 1 32 6 0 1 2 13 261 6 36 0 1 10
More ominous to SDI supporters , the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars .	29 53 7 0 1 2 6 0 1 64 18 163 16 21 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 33 11 0 1 12 0 1 10
The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space-based defenses .	6 1 20 94 18 19 6 1 32 0 1 57 32 1 12 0 1 10
But the Soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the U.S. does SDI testing or deployment that the Soviets think violates the existing anti-ballistic-missile treaty .	76 6 1 16 37 207 66 23 4 19 6 1 18 87 7 6 0 0 1 35 208 30 6 1 11 0 1 13 1 138 6 1 232 11 6 0 0 1 10
It will be hard down the road to persuade Congress to approve money for SDI plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty .	23 4 115 24 38 6 1 18 134 1 18 19 1 12 0 1 30 1 44 6 1 4 19 6 0 1 10
As a result , Frank Gaffney , a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy , charges that the administration 's professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity .	59 6 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 33 16 11 6 1 12 0 1 2 65 66 6 1 42 1 12 0 1 12 1 13 1 12 6 0 1 11 1 10
Still , proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI -- particularly when the public perceives the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev .	76 2 1 4 168 120 35 38 0 1 30 23 44 0 1 20 169 155 32 6 0 1 13 32 1 12 1 106 67 30 6 1 44 6 0 1 37 120 38 0 1 10
In fact , because communism seems to be beating a global retreat , some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs .	59 1 2 39 1 64 18 168 32 6 0 1 2 6 1 4 16 115 289 266 66 6 0 1 37 120 66 23 4 35 19 6 1 38 6 1 18 19 0 1 10
The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing , says Mitchell Daniels , a former Reagan White House aide who now is president of the Hudson Institute .	6 1 12 23 65 66 6 0 1 12 23 4 35 87 7 759 24 6 1 31 1 120 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 0 1 33 16 11 1 12 6 0 1 10
Some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes .	6 1 37 113 18 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
But they say they ca n't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide .	76 23 44 23 4 35 19 0 1 70 7 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 18 19 6 1 10
One longtime champion of these programs in Congress , Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia , is distracted by questions about his ethics , conservatives note .	0 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 0 1 704 123 924 1 2 14 40 38 1 12 6 1 2 1 27 10
Other conservative champions , like Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop , a longtime SDI advocate , do n't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan .	0 0 1 2 12 52 52 52 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 4 35 19 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 138 23 11 38 0 1 10
For there to be wind in the sails of any program , the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails , says Rep. Burton .	1339 50 18 19 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 0 1 64 18 168 120 38 6 1 2 56 0 1 10
All this causes Rep. Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm .	52 1 82 0 1 18 87 7 6 0 1 18 19 35 0 1 10
What I 'd like to see , if he is up to it , is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI , the congressman says .	119 23 4 154 18 19 2 337 23 48 161 7 23 2 592 198 1 18 87 7 6 1 18 19 1 12 1 2 6 1 34 10
We 're sorry to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission .	23 28 43 18 77 66 59 1 0 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
Mr. Allen , appointed by President Reagan , grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies .	0 1 2 40 38 0 1 2 28 29 53 155 45 7 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
His recent speech , provocatively titled Blacks ? Animals ? Homosexuals ? What is a Minority ? caused an uproar when its title leaked out .	6 0 1 2 16 15 1 10 78 10 78 10 33 11 6 1 10 11 6 1 30 6 1 34 35 10
Mr. Allen 's commissioners voted to call his unread speech thoughtless , disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory .	0 1 42 1 64 18 178 6 0 1 24 2 24 13 29 24 10
Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman .	0 0 0 1 44 23 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 33 11 1 10
Rep. Don Edwards , the California Democrat , warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction .	0 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 308 0 1 66 6 1 4 87 7 6 1 12 6 1 42 1 10
Thomas Stoddard , head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund , called the prospect of the speech frankly shocking .	0 1 2 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 136 6 1 12 6 1 29 24 10
We 've actually read the speech .	23 20 35 21 6 1 10
Mr. Allen began it with a warning to his hosts , a California church group that opposes rights for homosexuals .	0 1 11 23 38 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 0 0 1 33 11 1 12 1 10
He said that other participants in the conference do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual , but that I mean to persuade you to the opposite view .	23 65 66 0 1 12 6 1 4 35 77 66 6 1 12 1 4 74 22 7 1 33 28 24 2 13 66 23 64 18 19 23 38 6 0 1 10
He recalled to the audience a strange , infelicitous analogy he once heard arguing now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights , we need to do the same for animals .	23 186 7 6 1 6 0 2 0 1 23 16 11 214 137 39 23 20 35 174 66 0 1 11 1 2 23 64 18 5 6 1 7 1 10
Mr. Allen objected to this analogy because it seems to assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a mere project of charity , of humaneness .	0 1 48 7 6 1 30 23 64 18 19 6 1 12 1 38 23 12 1 67 38 6 0 1 12 1 2 12 1 10
Rights on such a basis , whether for blacks or homosexuals , are mere indulgences , he said , subject to being taken back .	1 12 52 6 1 2 230 7 1 13 1 2 11 0 1 2 23 44 2 24 399 182 40 35 10
He says the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals , not as members of certain select groups .	23 44 6 1 12 6 1 64 18 19 6 80 66 1 11 1 97 1 2 67 38 1 12 0 0 1 10
His speech criticized the idiocy of notions of protected groups in society as opposed to individual equality or , as he put it , in a common destiny as Americans .	6 1 11 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 12 1 196 40 38 0 1 13 2 1340 23 11 23 2 7 6 0 1 12 1 10
Instead of lobbying for special treatment , Mr. Allen said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk invidious retrenchment with government complicity .	122 155 45 7 0 1 2 0 1 65 66 1 13 1 4 154 18 19 0 1 12 6 1 13 16 87 7 0 1 33 4 19 0 1 12 0 1 10
This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed .	23 16 48 7 6 0 1 10
What 's really going on here ?	246 37 35 120 35 35 10
The three most important things to understand about Mr. Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual -- a triple threat to the liberal establishment .	6 0 36 0 1 18 19 38 0 1 65 66 23 11 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Mr. Allen , who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission , has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights .	0 1 2 33 11 1 38 0 0 0 1 12 1 13 4 19 6 1 12 6 1 2 20 21 1 207 66 0 1 11 1 42 1 10

Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again , which somehow elevated the vague concept of Indian rights above the rights of individual Indians .	0 1 16 28 53 7 6 0 1 35 2 90 16 73 6 0 1 12 0 1 7 6 1 12 0 1 10
There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen 's we're-all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups .	50 51 6 0 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Indeed , the gap is so large that Mr. Allen 's critics refuse to engage the debate .	76 2 6 1 28 289 24 66 0 1 42 1 64 18 19 6 1 10
Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument .	6 1 12 23 11 6 1 12 1 10

It added another 5 % Monday before stocks rallied .	23 11 36 0 1 35 30 1 34 10
When they did , the firm reduced those stock holdings to about 70 % .	39 23 34 2 6 1 11 6 0 1 38 36 0 1 10
A classic example of institutions ' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance , now widely discredited .	6 0 1 12 1 42 1 12 1 11 0 1 2 78 29 24 10
Before the 1987 crash , an estimated $ 60 billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique .	59 6 0 1 2 6 0 86 0 9 12 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 10
The idea was to insure the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped -- eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves .	6 1 64 18 19 6 1 12 6 1 57 32 1 30 0 1 34 57 32 6 1 18 19 6 1 123 10
But in October 1987 , when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets .	76 59 1 123 2 39 0 1 64 18 79 38 6 0 1 2 23 11 52 6 0 13 0 1 10
Yet even today , institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets .	76 76 105 2 1 37 16 32 1 12 0 1 57 16 120 35 13 35 38 6 1 10
Others are doing index arbitrage a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures .	1 37 32 0 1 92 1 1341 32 1 38 0 1 12 1 13 1 10
Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies , all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch .	59 0 0 1 2 23 12 6 1 65 262 0 1 87 7 1 18 19 1 57 32 13 32 1 38 6 1 10
But institutions say Wall Street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets .	76 1 44 0 0 0 1 28 29 43 18 19 1 10
Brokers do n't deny that .	1 4 35 19 23 10
Wall Street traders say that , with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s , securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock .	0 0 1 65 66 2 377 0 0 1 29 24 213 7 6 1 2 0 1 4 35 154 18 19 6 1 93 32 36 0 1 10
I think everyone 's a little more leery , says Jack Baker , head of equity trading at Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc .	23 44 23 28 29 29 29 24 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
The institutions have driven -LRB- commission -RRB- rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital , says Tom Gallagher , senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at Oppenheimer & Co .	6 1 20 21 314 1 167 1 35 38 6 1 75 192 390 6 1 18 19 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Why should I risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five cents a dance ?	243 244 23 19 1 38 6 1 78 33 37 146 23 0 1 92 1 10
All you get is risk .	23 23 11 11 1 10
Lack of liquidity can also result from exchange reforms .	1 12 1 4 35 87 7 0 1 10
Many traders say that circuit breakers put in place to damp volatility after the 1987 crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged Friday .	0 1 65 66 0 1 22 7 1 18 19 1 38 6 0 1 16 48 7 1 30 6 0 1 34 35 10
The circuit breakers caused a 30-minute shutdown in trading in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling .	6 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 1 12 0 0 1 42 0 0 0 1 30 6 1 37 120 10
With the futures-trading halt , you could only sell stocks to cut exposure to the market , says a money manager .	59 6 0 1 2 23 4 35 19 1 18 19 1 12 6 1 2 56 6 0 1 10
It was scary to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off .	23 28 24 38 1 207 66 23 4 35 19 6 1 35 10
It was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you there were three doors to exit , said one Chicago-based futures trader .	23 48 273 23 11 23 38 6 1 12 6 1 13 277 23 50 51 0 1 18 79 2 56 0 0 0 1 10
Then they said , By the way , two of the doors are locked .	76 23 44 2 59 6 1 2 1 12 6 1 28 24 10
The takeover mania also adds to volatility .	6 0 1 16 48 7 1 10
UAL Corp. is a good example .	0 1 11 6 0 1 10
Valued as a buy-out target , the airline stock was trading at nearly $ 280 a share .	22 7 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 37 45 7 0 86 9 92 1 10
When the deal ran into trouble , the stock tumbled ; it closed at $ 198 yesterday .	39 6 1 34 38 1 2 6 1 34 91 23 48 7 86 9 35 10
Presumably , UAL is now trading closer to its value based on earnings .	76 2 1 37 35 120 70 7 6 1 40 38 1 10
By contrast , traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves .	59 1 2 0 0 1 28 43 18 19 0 0 1 10
Scott Black , a value-oriented money manager who heads Delphi Management Inc. , points out that for those who invest on fundamentals , the value of a stock from day to day does n't change all that much .	0 1 2 6 0 0 1 33 11 0 0 1 2 65 35 66 59 23 33 34 38 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 295 1 12 1 4 35 115 29 29 24 10
Some experts say markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed .	6 1 44 1 28 35 29 24 63 16 40 10
Hans Stoll , finance professor at Vanderbilt University , says the current volatility in U.S. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s , decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced .	0 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 2 44 6 0 1 12 0 1 34 38 1 12 6 1 2 1 1342 0 1 69 12 1 13 1 14 40 10
I just ca n't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility , he says .	23 16 4 35 77 66 6 1 12 6 0 1 37 32 23 12 6 1 2 23 27 10
And Robert D. Arnott , president of asset allocator First Quadrant , notes that before Friday 's tailspin , daily volatility on the New York Stock Exchange in recent weeks had reached historically low levels .	76 0 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 65 66 59 1 42 1 2 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 85 0 1 20 21 36 0 1 10
Some people tend to ignore that a 50-point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower .	6 1 64 18 77 66 6 0 1 28 53 7 0 1 47 23 34 30 6 0 1 28 24 10
John J. Phelan Jr. , chairman of the Big Board , asserts that 1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years .	0 0 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 2 65 66 1 13 1 20 21 1 12 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 0 13 0 1 10
But the low average volatility Mr. Phelan is talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week .	76 6 0 0 1 0 1 37 45 7 11 35 6 1 38 6 1 12 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
In addition , Sanford Grossman , a Wharton School finance professor , says volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions who can go out and say I have a billion dollars of stocks to sell .	59 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 2 44 0 1 12 0 1 4 79 67 35 117 1 28 53 7 6 0 1 12 1 33 4 79 35 13 215 23 11 36 0 1 12 1 18 19 10
Some people think the search for liquidity is fruitless .	6 1 44 6 1 12 1 28 24 10
In 1936 , John Maynard Keynes wrote that of the maxims of orthodox finance none , surely , is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity .	59 1 2 0 0 1 65 66 59 6 1 12 0 1 1 2 16 2 28 29 24 84 6 1 12 1 10
It leads investors to focus on short-term price movements -- a game of musical chairs , he called it -- rather than on long-term fundamental valuation .	23 82 1 18 79 38 0 0 1 75 6 1 12 0 1 2 23 108 23 106 102 13 38 0 0 1 10

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe , which is to be launched today .	6 0 1 13 0 1 44 6 0 1 20 21 1 12 6 1 13 37 32 0 1 22 7 6 0 0 1 2 33 64 18 74 40 35 10
Charles Redmond , a NASA spokesman , said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today .	0 1 2 6 0 1 2 44 6 1 11 6 1 38 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 16 15 1 13 82 0 0 1 18 74 40 38 1 10
Although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle , part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn .	39 6 1 14 35 22 7 6 0 1 33 11 52 1 13 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 4 19 1 12 0 1 30 6 1 28 24 10
Mr. Redmond said the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared garbage data could be substituted for real data .	0 1 44 6 1 20 35 35 21 6 1 13 6 1 44 0 1 4 74 22 7 0 1 10
He estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system .	23 44 192 283 501 6 1 198 6 0 0 1 18 5 6 1 7 6 0 1 10
The intruder , among the broadest yet to hit a research network , appeared to affect only Digital Equipment Corp. hardware that uses Digital 's VAX\/VMS operating system .	6 1 2 12 6 1 123 18 19 6 0 1 2 64 18 19 0 0 0 0 1 33 11 1 42 0 0 1 10
It is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that last year infected Arpanet , a much larger network used by researchers at universities , laboratories and government agencies around the world .	23 28 53 7 6 0 1 33 72 16 11 1 2 6 36 0 1 40 38 1 12 1 2 1 13 0 1 12 6 1 10
In the lingo of computer security , the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm , Mr. Redmond said .	59 6 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 11 35 6 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks .	6 1 34 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 13 34 57 120 38 0 1 40 38 1 10
The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA 's Space Physics Analysis Network , Mr. Redmond said .	6 0 1 16 14 40 38 6 1 12 1 40 35 38 1 42 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
NASA said the Galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms .	1 44 6 0 1 20 35 21 6 1 13 6 1 12 0 0 1 30 23 20 195 6 1 18 19 1 10
But Mr. Redmond said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes .	76 0 1 44 6 1 11 1 33 20 35 94 18 19 6 1 10
Michael Alexander , a senior editor at Computerworld , a trade publication , said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the user 's name .	0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 2 6 0 1 2 44 23 14 351 66 6 1 48 7 6 0 1 57 45 7 0 1 106 69 12 1 33 11 6 1 217 6 1 42 1 10
If it finds one and gets into the system , it will display a screen when a user logs on that says , Worms Against Nuclear Killers ... .	39 23 11 1 13 48 7 6 1 2 23 4 19 6 1 30 6 1 34 35 90 34 2 1 12 0 1 106 10
You talk of times of peace for all , and then prepare for war .	23 34 38 1 12 1 12 23 2 13 16 48 7 1 10
In addition , Mr. Alexander said , the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center -- such as , George Orwell was an optimist , or Do n't feed the bats tonight .	59 1 2 0 1 44 2 6 1 73 0 1 7 0 1 12 6 1 67 67 90 2 0 1 595 6 1 2 13 4 35 19 6 1 35 10
The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user .	6 1 16 48 7 0 1 33 11 0 1 38 6 1 10
The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running .	6 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 30 23 14 40 13 14 17 18 74 40 67 35 117 6 1 28 24 13 120 10
If it finds one of those passwords , Mr. Alexander said , the worm will do such things as change users ' passwords to a series of random numbers , preventing them from signing on to the network .	39 23 11 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 44 2 6 1 4 19 52 1 33 73 1 42 1 7 6 1 12 0 1 2 111 23 155 120 35 38 6 1 10
NASA estimated that , on Monday , about four computer centers were affected .	1 65 66 2 59 1 2 0 0 0 1 14 40 10
Yesterday , the number grew to 40 ; today the number is expected to grow to 100 .	76 2 6 1 34 38 1 91 76 6 1 14 17 18 79 38 1 10
NASA said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the 6,000 connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage , if any .	1 44 23 4 19 52 6 1 30 23 11 52 456 0 1 12 1343 1 22 7 1 14 40 13 6 1 12 6 1 2 12 23 10
Anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft .	0 1 20 21 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 30 23 82 1 18 19 6 1 17 18 19 6 1 10
Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying Galileo into orbit should explode , or if Galileo itself crashes into the Earth during the two times it flies close to the planet , fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere .	1 65 66 39 6 1 32 1 38 1 4 79 2 13 39 1 123 34 38 6 1 38 6 0 1 23 107 719 7 6 1 2 0 1 12 1 4 74 40 38 6 1 10
So far Galileo has been delayed twice , once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space-shuttle engine , and yesterday because of the weather .	137 76 1 20 151 40 35 2 35 70 7 6 0 1 22 7 6 0 1 2 13 35 70 7 6 1 10
NASA said the Galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay .	1 44 6 0 1 11 23 18 5 7 6 1 10
Mr. Alexander of Computerworld said hackers have gone after SPAN before .	0 1 12 1 44 1 20 60 38 1 35 10
He said the Chaos Computer Club , of West Germany , once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi , messing up some calculations .	23 44 6 0 0 1 2 12 0 1 2 16 64 18 19 1 13 19 52 1 238 19 6 1 12 1 2 32 35 6 1 10
It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought .	192 701 35 6 1 66 1 37 32 0 1 38 1 75 59 6 0 1 123 52 6 0 1 216 148 4 163 151 40 10
Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts .	76 192 383 35 24 66 6 1 18 19 0 1 48 161 7 6 1 2 13 161 7 1 10
Beginning in the early 19th century , with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in British law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers .	122 7 6 0 0 1 2 222 1 12 1 13 1 2 6 0 1 20 35 174 66 6 0 1 18 134 1 18 87 7 6 0 1 13 29 24 2 251 29 24 487 0 1 2 4 19 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 1 10
That 's the conventional theory anyway .	23 11 6 0 1 35 10
In practice , however , the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur .	59 1 2 76 2 6 1 12 1 13 1 12 6 0 1 72 16 64 18 79 10
In particular , a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade .	59 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 20 60 38 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
For example , although insider trading has long been criminal , it has never been statutorily defined .	59 1 2 39 0 1 20 35 164 24 2 23 20 35 151 16 40 10
In 1983 , the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v. SEC decision , which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain some personal gain and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact .	59 1 2 6 0 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 38 6 0 71 1 1 2 33 65 66 1 48 309 55 6 1 20 21 6 0 1 12 6 1 322 1 18 19 6 0 1 13 55 6 1 11 13 16 11 6 1 10
Gradually , however , lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point .	76 2 76 2 0 1 13 1 20 21 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
Consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of Robert Chestman .	19 6 1 32 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Prior to a tender offer by A&P for Waldbaum Inc. in 1986 , the founder of the Waldbaum 's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery .	137 59 6 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 12 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 11 6 0 1 18 134 23 18 5 6 0 1 7 1 10
She called her daughter to take her to the bank , who , in turn , persuaded her husband , a Mr. Loeb , to run this errand .	23 11 6 1 18 5 23 7 6 1 2 90 2 85 1 2 82 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 18 19 6 1 10
Hearing of this information , the husband discussed it with his broker , Mr. Chestman , and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients .	45 7 6 1 2 6 1 11 23 38 6 1 2 0 1 2 13 0 1 16 34 38 6 0 1 13 0 1 10
Basically , Mr. Chestman was a fourth-level tippee .	76 2 0 1 11 6 0 1 10
Did Mr. Loeb seek personal gain -LRB- and if so , how -RRB- ?	244 0 1 19 0 1 1285 13 76 105 2 588 167 10
Or did Mr. Chestman only hear a market rumor -LRB- which one may lawfully trade upon -RRB- ?	76 244 0 1 16 19 6 0 1 166 138 1 4 16 87 7 167 10
The line seems awfully thin for criminal-law purposes .	6 1 28 29 24 38 0 1 10
A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by Robert Freeman , formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman , Sachs & Co .	6 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 0 1 40 38 0 1 2 52 1 12 1 12 0 2 0 0 1 10
Essentially , Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out , when he was told by another prominent trader , Bernard Bunny Lasker , that the deal was in trouble .	76 2 0 1 20 60 35 38 6 0 0 1 2 30 23 14 351 38 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 66 6 1 48 7 1 10
After placing orders to sell , Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel , an investment banker at Kidder , Peabody & Co. , who was advising on the deal , to confirm these rumors .	181 32 1 18 79 2 0 1 11 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 2 0 0 1 2 33 37 45 7 6 1 2 18 19 6 1 10
Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was and , on hearing that it was Bunny Lasker , responded : Well , your bunny has a good nose .	0 1 11 0 1 471 6 1 11 13 2 211 207 66 23 11 0 1 2 44 106 76 2 6 1 11 6 0 1 10
The illegal tip of the bunny 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market .	6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 11 35 35 6 1 12 1 16 22 7 1 12 6 1 10
Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced :	165 6 1 60 38 1 6 0 1 4 163 60 106
Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain ?	1047 50 6 0 1 1344 1 18 19 0 1 10
Did Mr. Freeman have notice of this ?	244 0 1 19 1 12 23 10
Finally , was the information material ?	76 2 343 6 1 24 10
Yet , all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue : Who is and who should be making the criminal law here ?	76 2 52 6 1 28 53 7 6 36 0 1 400 246 37 13 246 4 168 32 6 0 1 35 10
It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness .	192 701 35 6 1 66 52 0 1 13 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Arguably , both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky .	76 2 23 48 7 80 66 6 1 28 636 148 24 10
But even if they behaved recklessly , reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading .	76 137 39 23 34 35 2 1 16 34 18 19 13 19 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 10
Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors .	1 13 1 11 1 38 36 0 1 13 28 35 53 7 36 0 1 12 1 10
After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method .	0 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 20 35 21 6 0 1 42 1 10
When only civil liability is involved , this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization .	39 0 0 1 14 40 2 6 1 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 12 1 10
Still , case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc -LRB- and usually sleazy -RRB- examples .	76 2 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 28 53 7 6 0 1 40 38 6 1 12 0 210 166 13 36 0 167 1 10
When a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct , it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule .	39 6 1 65 66 6 0 1 42 1 28 24 13 16 82 6 1 12 0 1 18 19 6 1 2 23 4 35 19 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 33 4 74 40 38 6 0 1 10
Thus , a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule .	76 2 6 1 28 29 43 18 19 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
For example , in focusing on Mr. Freeman 's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal 's collapse , one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin : What if the rumor had been false ?	59 1 2 181 120 38 0 1 42 1 18 19 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 2 1 4 35 16 79 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 106 69 75 6 1 20 164 24 10
Can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false ?	244 6 0 1 134 6 0 1 18 556 24 66 6 36 0 1 28 35 208 24 10
In the past , not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company , but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts .	59 6 1 2 137 523 529 0 1 163 94 18 19 35 52 1 38 6 1 2 76 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 14 17 38 6 1 18 87 35 7 52 1 12 0 1 10
Today , after Mr. Freeman 's plea , there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient .	76 2 59 0 1 42 1 2 50 51 6 1 33 28 29 24 13 24 10
In this light , the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Before it acts , the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision , not just the immediate parties before the court ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the legislature can frame bright line standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts .	59 6 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 482 24 106 166 76 167 39 23 34 2 6 1 16 4 19 6 1 12 1 12 52 1 40 38 6 1 2 52 52 6 0 1 12 6 1 91 13 166 76 167 6 1 4 19 0 0 1 33 11 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
Although legislative lines can result in under-inclusion -LRB- which explains why the SEC has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading -RRB- , judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions .	39 0 1 4 87 7 1 166 90 162 55 6 1 20 35 21 6 0 1 12 0 1 167 2 0 1 16 11 1 70 7 6 0 0 1 13 1 12 0 0 1 10
At least when the stakes are high , uncertainty in turn results in overinclusion , as individuals do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely .	109 24 39 6 1 28 24 2 1 12 1 48 7 1 2 30 1 4 35 154 18 19 6 0 1 35 10
The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime .	6 0 0 13 0 0 1 11 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
In 1987 , the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v. U.S. to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues .	59 1 2 6 0 1 64 38 1 12 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 57 32 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Yet , late last year , Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services .	76 2 137 137 76 2 1 16 11 6 1 57 32 6 0 1 33 82 1 18 19 6 1 18 19 23 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
At a stroke , this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches -LRB- and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee -RRB- .	59 6 1 2 23 4 19 6 0 1 166 13 52 6 1 12 6 1 13 1 167 10
Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem : Congress finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions , which the courts must thereafter interpret , than to engage in the difficult line-drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility .	52 6 1 11 6 0 1 75 1 44 192 193 24 18 19 36 0 1 2 138 6 1 4 35 19 2 500 18 79 38 6 0 0 1 33 11 35 6 1 10
We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway .	23 14 40 70 7 6 0 0 1 815 7 6 0 1 10
Predictably , when confronted with morally dubious behavior , prosecutors will exploit the latitude such openended statutes give them .	76 2 218 22 7 36 0 1 2 1 4 19 6 1 52 0 1 108 23 10
Over the long run , however , sleazy cases will make bad law .	59 6 0 1 2 76 2 0 1 4 19 0 1 10

As for joint ventures , Mr. Houghton said profit was essentially flat due primarily to a slow recovery at Samsung-Corning Co. in Korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to China .	122 7 0 1 2 0 1 44 1 28 29 24 67 67 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 1 12 1 12 1 10

Friday 's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for CD rollovers , when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way .	1 42 0 1 34 67 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 75 6 1 12 1 13 1 16 73 1 7 1 10

Mr. Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs , but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding .	0 1 65 66 0 1 28 29 24 38 0 13 0 1 2 13 1 12 1 40 38 6 0 1 14 40 38 36 0 1 10

What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit reported yesterday make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise any time soon , said Mr. Mehl of Banxquote .	118 34 38 6 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 40 35 785 192 24 66 0 0 1 4 79 81 1 208 2 56 0 1 12 1 10
Even before the market drop , rates were down about half a percentage point , said Robert J. Hutchinson , senior vice president for retail marketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York .	137 59 6 0 1 2 1 28 126 52 627 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 10

Conservatives have an important decision to make this fall .	1 11 6 0 1 18 19 81 1 10
At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the IMF 's capital base .	59 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 11 6 1 18 19 38 1 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 10
While the U.S. share of the increase probably will not reach the $ 12 billion or more implicit in the IMF 's request for a doubling of its $ 90 billion capital , the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase .	39 6 0 1 12 6 1 16 4 35 19 6 86 0 9 69 78 24 84 6 1 42 1 12 6 1 12 6 125 0 9 1 2 6 1 16 4 87 7 6 0 1 10
This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and G-7 exchange-rate intervention , and with its financial commitment to Mexico , Poland and others .	23 4 115 53 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 13 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 1 13 1 10
The IMF has several reasons for requesting the increase .	6 1 11 0 1 93 32 6 1 10
Its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s .	6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 20 60 35 38 6 1 10
The size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the Brady Plan , which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved countries .	6 1 13 1 12 1 4 115 24 38 6 0 1 2 33 73 0 13 0 1 7 0 1 10
At least three other factors have encouraged the IMF to insist on increased capital .	305 148 0 0 1 20 195 6 1 18 87 7 0 1 10
First , it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets , for which it feels some responsibility .	76 2 23 65 66 6 0 1 4 74 40 443 1 18 19 6 1 24 84 0 0 1 2 12 124 23 11 6 1 10
Second , the World Bank 's recent $ 75 billion capital increase -- $ 14 billion from the U.S. -- has left the IMF feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions .	76 2 6 0 1 42 0 125 0 9 0 1 12 86 0 9 12 6 1 106 20 21 6 1 156 24 84 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Third , the IMF would like to meet Japan 's request for increased ownership -LRB- currently 4.5 % -RRB- .	76 2 6 1 4 154 18 19 1 42 1 12 0 1 12 36 0 1 167 10
Japan has supported a larger role for the IMF in developing-country debt issues , and is an important financial resource for IMF-guided programs in developing countries .	1 20 21 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 13 11 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 10
While international politics may argue for the capital increase , there is a clear economic case against it .	39 0 1 4 87 7 6 0 1 2 50 51 6 0 0 1 12 23 10
Opponents of the increase argue that the IMF practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments .	1 12 6 1 65 66 6 1 11 0 1 57 32 0 1 10
They question whether the IMF has any role in developing countries , given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in balance-of-payments emergencies .	23 162 55 6 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 2 38 6 0 1 18 19 0 1 38 0 1 10
Opponents show that there are already more funds available than commendable reform efforts .	1 65 66 50 51 35 0 1 24 12 0 0 1 10
They worry that new IMF funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting IMF debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt , a bad trade all around .	23 65 66 0 0 1 12 0 1 4 35 168 35 111 0 1 7 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 69 78 10
They believe microeconomics , which addresses the problems of markets , investment climate and management practices , is the key to developing-country growth , not the IMF 's Keynesian focus on trade deficits , quarterly targets and government debt .	23 44 1 2 33 11 6 1 12 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 2 11 6 1 12 0 1 2 52 6 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 10
They point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated , taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive IMF programs .	23 48 7 6 0 0 1 33 20 139 2 139 13 139 23 7 1 38 0 0 1 10
Decisions on increases in the IMF 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration , with subsequent authorization by Congress .	1 12 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 16 14 40 38 6 1 2 38 1 78 12 1 10
The last U.S. congressional authorization , in 1983 , was a political donnybrook and carried a $ 6 billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes .	6 0 0 0 1 2 12 1 2 11 6 0 1 13 11 6 125 0 9 0 1 70 7 23 18 19 0 1 10
The politics of the 1990 congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations .	6 1 12 6 0 0 1 28 43 18 115 53 7 23 12 0 1 10
Liberals may support the stabilizing , quasi-governmental role of the IMF on two conditions : that the administration give assurances that liberal Democrats ' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns ; and that the legislation address -- with dollars -- social and environmental concerns .	1 4 19 6 0 2 0 1 12 6 1 38 0 1 106 75 6 1 11 80 66 0 1 42 1 4 35 74 22 7 23 38 0 0 1 91 13 75 6 1 11 106 38 1 106 0 13 0 1 10

A U.S. decision to refuse the IMF its capital increase , or limit it to 25 % , would bring a major change in international economic policy , and could not be taken lightly .	6 0 1 18 221 6 1 6 0 1 2 13 5 23 7 0 1 2 4 19 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 13 4 35 74 152 24 10
Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets .	1 4 87 7 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase , a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged .	39 0 1 13 6 0 1 44 23 4 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 4 276 23 156 24 10
Furthermore , a U.S. rejection of the capital increase -LRB- and transfer of shares to Japan -RRB- would give Japan an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing .	76 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 166 13 1 12 1 12 1 167 4 221 1 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 10
On the other hand , a decision to increase the IMF 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 18 19 6 1 42 1 4 19 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 10

In a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to Time Warner Inc. 's powerful Home Box Office , cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. agreed to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. from Viacom Inc. for $ 225 million .	59 6 1 33 4 5 6 0 0 1 7 0 0 1 42 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 64 18 5 23 12 0 0 1 7 0 1 38 86 0 9 10
The purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between TCI and Viacom , which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators .	6 1 34 38 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 13 1 2 33 20 35 139 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 7 0 0 1 10
Showtime is a distant No. 2 to Home Box Office , and in May filed a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit against Time Warner , charging the company and its HBO and American Television cable units with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business .	1 11 6 0 1 123 12 0 0 1 2 13 85 1 1146 6 125 0 9 0 1 7 0 1 2 111 6 1 13 6 0 13 0 0 0 1 155 113 18 19 6 0 0 1 10
HBO has close to 24 million subscribers to its HBO and Cinemax networks , while Showtime and its sister service , The Movie Channel , have only about 10 million , according to Paul Kagan Associates , a Carmel , Calif. , research firm .	1 11 6 486 52 6 1 12 6 0 13 0 1 2 30 1 13 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 11 36 0 1 123 2 70 7 0 0 1 2 6 36 2 0 2 0 1 10
For TCI , the investment in Showtime puts it in an unusual position ; as the largest cable operator , with control of close to 12 million of the nation 's 52 million cable subscribers , TCI is HBO 's largest customer .	59 1 2 6 1 12 1 1345 23 7 6 0 1 91 59 6 0 0 1 2 12 1 12 1 132 0 1 12 6 1 42 36 0 0 1 2 1 11 1 42 0 1 10
But TCI President John Malone has long been concerned about HBO 's dominance of the pay TV business , and has been eager to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor .	76 0 0 0 1 20 35 151 22 7 1 42 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 13 20 164 43 18 5 1 7 6 0 1 10
It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace , Mr. Malone said in a statement .	192 383 53 7 6 0 1 66 23 11 6 0 13 0 0 1 2 0 1 27 153 6 1 10
In a telephone interview , Robert Thomson , TCI senior vice president , said Showtime 's suit against HBO does n't involve us , and nothing we 're doing here bears any relationship to that .	59 6 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 44 1 42 1 12 1 4 35 19 23 2 13 23 23 37 32 35 73 6 1 7 23 10
He added , We do n't intend to be drawn into it , noting that TCI wo n't play any active role in the management of Showtime .	23 44 2 23 4 35 154 18 74 40 38 23 2 207 66 1 4 35 19 6 0 1 38 6 1 12 1 10
Linking up Showtime with the largest cable operator in the U.S. could sharply boost its subscribers .	111 35 1 7 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 4 16 19 6 1 10
TCI said it may bring in other cable operators as investors , a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks , such as The Discovery Channel .	1 44 23 4 1133 24 0 0 1 7 1 2 6 1 23 20 21 38 6 1 38 1 12 0 0 1 2 69 12 0 0 1 10
Additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further .	0 0 1 4 19 1 67 35 10
Time Warner declined comment .	0 1 11 1 10

The TCI investment is a big victory for Viacom 's chief executive officer , Frank Biondi , and Winston H. Cox , president of the Showtime unit .	6 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 13 0 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 10

The fight between HBO and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr. Biondi is the former chief executive of HBO , and Mr. Cox served as chief of marketing for the service .	6 1 12 1 13 1 28 29 24 30 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 13 0 1 48 7 1 12 1 38 6 1 10

We do n't want to bring back something the members will reject .	23 4 35 154 18 535 24 23 6 1 4 19 10

It was n't clear , however , whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corp. , a San Antonio , Texas-based data-processing systems maker .	192 331 35 24 2 35 2 55 6 1 14 22 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 2 6 36 36 2 0 0 0 1 10

That 's the view of some analysts here who argue that Britain 's leading maker of luxury cars still may have two U.S. auto giants battling for it .	23 11 6 1 12 6 1 78 33 65 66 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 16 4 276 0 0 0 1 45 7 23 10

Both Ford and its rival General Motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company .	52 1 13 0 0 0 1 16 73 6 1 155 32 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Ford 's latest move increases the pressure on GM to complete its current talks with Jaguar quickly .	1 42 0 1 11 6 1 12 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 35 10
GM is likely to reach the cooperative operating pact it has been seeking in about two weeks , knowledgeable individuals say .	1 28 43 18 19 6 0 0 1 23 20 121 32 38 0 0 1 2 0 1 27 10

Ford 's share purchases undoubtedly accounted for much of Monday 's heavy trading .	1 42 0 1 16 48 7 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
Last week , many Jaguar shareholders took their money and ran .	137 76 2 0 0 1 11 6 1 13 34 10
Fears that Ford 's ardor might be cooling put Jaguar shares into reverse after GM confirmed its friendly negotiations with Jaguar .	80 66 1 42 1 4 168 120 73 0 1 7 1 30 1 11 6 0 1 12 1 10
But yesterday 's announcement indicates that Ford has n't lost interest .	76 1 42 1 65 66 1 20 35 21 1 10
Both Shearson 's Mr . Will and Stephen Reitman , European auto analyst at the London brokerage firm UBS-Phillips & Drew , recently switched their Jaguar recommendations to hold from buy .	52 1 274 0 10 1 13 0 1 2 0 0 1 217 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 16 385 6 0 1 7 1 7 1 10
Sit tight through the coming volatility , Mr. Reitman suggests , though he concedes that many small investors will find Jaguar 's zigzags too hard to swallow .	79 35 38 6 0 1 2 0 1 433 2 104 23 65 66 0 0 1 4 178 1 42 1 686 24 18 19 10
But a crucial point is how Ford reacts when GM , the world 's largest auto maker , firms up its proposed deal with Jaguar .	76 6 0 1 162 55 1 162 55 1 2 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 11 35 6 0 1 12 1 10

GM is expected to inject roughly # 200 million -LRB- $ 316 million -RRB- by acquiring some Jaguar shares , and then win Jaguar management 's promise of an eventual 30 % stake .	1 14 17 18 19 0 86 0 9 12 86 0 9 167 57 32 6 0 1 2 13 16 19 0 1 42 1 12 6 0 36 0 1 10
Analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models , doubling Jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars .	1 44 6 0 1 16 4 19 0 1 18 19 0 0 1 2 32 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 10
Jaguar shareholders would have to bless such a far-reaching accord .	0 1 4 154 18 19 52 6 0 1 10
Ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the U.K. government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early .	1 4 19 6 1 57 32 6 0 1 30 1 13 6 0 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 35 10

Ford wants -LCB- Jaguar -RCB- very much .	1 11 166 1 167 67 35 10
U.S. takeover-stock speculators , who may own between 20 % and 30 % of Jaguar , could give Ford enough votes to block the GM deal .	0 0 1 2 33 4 19 0 0 1 13 0 1 12 1 2 4 221 1 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
GM might counterbid .	1 20 60 10

He believes Jaguar 's share price could zoom to between # 8 and # 10 -LRB- $ 12.60 to $ 15.80 -RRB- .	23 44 1 42 0 1 4 79 38 0 86 9 13 86 9 12 86 9 132 86 9 167 10
There 's quite a bit of value left in the -LCB- Jaguar -RCB- shares here even though they have run up lately , says Doug Johnson , a fund manager for Seattle-based Safeco Asset Management .	50 51 52 6 1 12 1 40 38 52 166 1 167 78 78 67 30 23 20 60 35 35 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
At the moment , he intends to keep the firm 's 180,000 Jaguar shares .	59 6 1 2 23 64 18 19 6 1 42 0 0 1 10
The risk is that Jaguar 's share price could slump if GM 's agreement with Jaguar effectively locks out its U.S. rival .	6 1 65 66 1 42 0 1 4 79 30 1 42 1 12 1 16 11 35 6 0 1 10
Ford 's appetite to attack -LCB- Jaguar -RCB- could gradually wane over time , particularly if Saab is a reasonably attractive proposition , says John Lawson , an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute .	1 42 1 18 19 166 1 167 4 16 79 38 1 2 35 30 1 11 6 36 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 10
He thinks Saab-Scania AB on Friday will announce the sale of 50 % of its car division to Ford ; the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months .	23 44 0 1 85 1 4 19 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 91 6 1 20 121 32 0 1 38 1 10
Clifford Stahl , president and chief investment officer of C-S Capital Advisors Inc. , two weeks ago sold his Cincinnati firm 's 107,100 Jaguar ADRs at about 10 each , making a tidy profit on a holding purchased at 4 7\/8 in early May .	0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 357 73 6 0 1 42 0 0 1 7 0 1 78 2 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 40 38 0 1 38 0 1 10

Observers said it appeared that British Air was angered at the way the bid has degenerated into confusion , as well as by the banks ' effort to round up financing for what one called a deal that is n't a deal .	1 44 23 65 66 0 1 14 40 38 6 1 6 1 20 169 7 1 2 102 102 13 38 6 1 42 1 18 19 35 1 12 119 23 108 6 1 33 11 35 6 1 10

The pilots were meeting outside Chicago yesterday .	6 1 37 120 38 1 35 10

A group of United 's noncontract employees said in a statement , The fact that Wolf and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of United is not only deplorable but inexcusable .	6 1 12 1 42 0 1 44 38 6 1 2 6 80 66 1 13 0 1 37 113 18 5 6 1 7 0 1 12 1 57 32 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 28 29 29 24 13 24 10

Although it may not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy-out group ca n't revive its bid , it may have to explore alternatives if the buyers come back with a bid much lower than the group 's original $ 300-a-share proposal .	39 23 4 35 74 16 17 18 19 6 1 30 6 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 2 23 4 154 18 19 1 30 6 1 48 35 7 6 1 29 24 84 6 1 42 0 125 9 1 10
At a meeting Sept. 1 to consider the labor-management bid , the board also was informed by its investment adviser , First Boston Corp. , of interest expressed by buy-out funds including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Forstmann Little & Co. , as well as by Robert Bass , Morgan Stanley 's buy-out fund , and Pan Am Corp .	59 6 1 340 9 18 19 6 0 1 2 6 1 16 14 22 38 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 7 1 40 38 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 0 1 2 102 102 13 38 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 2 13 0 0 1 10

When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a two-note phrase , a descending minor third , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film .	218 22 7 1 38 6 1 2 6 1 11 6 0 1 2 30 208 6 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 11 6 36 0 1 12 1 2 1 13 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 10

In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. Greve informs your readers , ... the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge -LRB- Congress's Environmental Buccaneers , Sept. 18 -RRB- .	59 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 0 0 1 277 6 1 2 106 6 0 0 1 14 40 38 6 80 217 6 1 2 78 106 66 23 13 0 1 4 79 91 23 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 38 0 0 1 2 340 9 167 10
This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong .	6 1 16 11 6 0 80 66 0 1 28 29 24 13 24 2 13 23 28 29 24 10
The Clean Water Act contains no legal standard of zero discharge .	6 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
It requires that discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301 .	23 298 299 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 74 40 38 1 33 11 6 0 1 40 38 1 123 10

Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress 's meaningless statement of the national goal in section 101 , which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985 , no less .	76 0 1 14 40 38 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 123 2 33 250 48 7 6 1 12 1 38 240 1 2 6 1 10

Thus , you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests , even facetiously , that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water ; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters , from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors .	76 2 23 108 6 1 6 0 1 30 0 1 65 2 67 35 2 66 6 0 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 13 1 91 6 0 1 4 74 17 18 77 66 23 13 1 13 1 73 23 2 30 23 34 38 6 1 38 6 1 13 1 2 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 10

The reason , ad executives say , is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market .	6 1 2 0 1 44 2 65 66 6 0 0 1 20 164 24 106 13 0 1 11 6 1 33 136 23 29 24 38 6 0 1 10
Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $ 130,000 for a four-color page , vs. $ 47,000 for the Smithsonian , a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation .	76 6 1 12 6 1 11 6 0 0 1 106 340 9 112 6 0 1 2 250 623 9 403 6 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 36 0 1 10
When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers , who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all .	39 0 1 28 24 2 6 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 1 2 33 16 64 18 79 35 68 6 1 13 35 68 23 10
Even though National Geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like Smithsonian , the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency , says Harry Glass , New York media manager for Bozell Inc .	137 39 0 1 11 36 0 1 707 206 6 1 12 1 2 6 1 601 23 6 1 13 6 1 18 19 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
To combat that problem , National Geographic , like other magazines , began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example , ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets .	18 19 6 1 2 0 1 2 85 0 1 2 37 32 0 1 229 1 18 79 38 52 6 1 12 6 1 104 59 1 2 1 4 79 67 38 6 1 22 7 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions , and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors .	76 6 1 28 24 84 6 1 18 87 35 7 6 0 1 2 13 85 0 1 11 1 12 23 707 206 1 10
Time magazine , for example , has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions , top management , and other groups .	0 1 2 85 1 2 11 24 25 0 0 1 120 38 0 1 2 0 1 2 13 0 1 10
Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic 's tradition of lumping its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most magazines do .	6 0 1 12 1 11 0 1 42 1 93 32 6 1 35 2 67 38 6 1 13 1 12 6 1 2 102 13 32 1 35 38 6 1 2 30 0 1 34 10
And National Geographic 's smaller-than-average size means extra production costs for advertisers .	76 0 1 42 0 1 11 0 0 1 12 1 10
But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back .	76 0 1 44 6 1 37 120 35 10
It now offers 30 regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales force .	23 16 11 0 0 1 2 23 72 16 37 32 1 70 7 1 2 13 23 20 121 32 35 6 0 1 10
And it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives , marketing directors , and media executives just that .	76 23 16 11 6 0 1 18 221 0 1 2 0 1 2 13 0 1 0 1 10
The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign , into which the magazine will pour about $ 500,000 , mostly in the next few weeks .	6 1 12 6 1 11 6 0 0 1 2 12 124 6 1 4 19 0 86 9 2 67 38 6 0 0 1 10
The campaign , created by Omnicom Group 's DDB Needham agency , takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for .	6 1 2 40 38 0 1 42 0 0 1 2 73 1 7 6 0 1 138 0 1 14 22 7 10
In one ad , a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline , The only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising .	59 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 14 22 7 6 1 2 6 0 1 29 24 84 1 4 35 19 1 10
Another ad pictures a tree ant , magnified 80 times , with the headline , For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions .	6 1 11 6 0 1 2 40 67 35 2 38 6 1 2 85 1 69 12 6 1 19 6 0 1 10
Ms. McCraw says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in 10 categories , including corporate , financial services , consumer electronics , insurance and food .	0 1 44 23 82 6 1 18 143 19 1 12 0 1 2 12 0 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 13 1 10
Her goal : to top 300 ad pages in 1990 , up from about 274 this year .	6 1 98 18 19 0 0 1 38 1 2 70 7 0 1 373 1 10
Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain .	55 23 4 19 6 0 1 354 185 161 46 24 10
The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of National Geographic , she says .	6 0 1 14 17 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 2 23 27 10
We want it to be a '90s kind of image .	23 82 23 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 10
WCRS Plans Ad-Unit Sale	1 11 0 1
WCRS Group hopes to announce , perhaps today , an agreement to sell the majority of its ad unit to Paris-based Eurocom , a European ad executive said .	0 1 64 18 19 2 0 1 2 6 1 18 5 6 1 12 6 0 1 7 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 27 10
WCRS has been in discussions with Eurocom for several months .	1 20 169 7 1 12 1 38 0 1 10
However , when negotiations bogged down recently , WCRS 's chief executive , Peter Scott , met in Paris with another French firm , Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit , or BDDP .	76 2 39 1 34 35 35 2 1 42 0 1 2 0 1 2 48 38 1 7 6 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 13 1 10
According to the executive , BDDP 's involvement prompted renewed vigor in the WCRS-Eurocom talks and the two agencies were hoping to hammer out details by today .	122 7 6 1 2 1 42 1 11 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 37 113 18 19 35 1 38 1 10

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges , a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders .	6 0 0 0 1 64 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 29 43 18 19 0 1 13 1 10
The CFTC said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice .	6 1 44 23 4 19 6 1 38 6 1 12 6 1 33 11 0 0 1 45 7 0 1 13 11 1 22 7 6 1 10
Dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers .	0 1 108 6 0 1 6 1 18 79 67 38 6 0 1 13 38 1 10
The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange .	6 1 34 81 1 30 6 36 0 71 1 1 48 7 1 12 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 13 0 0 1 10
While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations .	218 16 16 40 38 6 0 1 2 0 1 11 6 1 12 1 18 19 0 1 10
Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders .	1 65 66 1 37 32 1 13 1 12 6 0 1 70 7 0 1 42 0 1 10
Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders .	1 28 43 18 19 52 1 30 0 1 11 6 1 18 19 1 38 0 1 75 50 51 6 1 12 0 1 10
The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand .	6 1 65 66 0 1 11 1 12 6 1 30 1 4 79 13 79 67 30 23 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 1 10
The exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration .	6 1 44 1 11 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 69 12 23 12 6 0 1 120 38 1 10
The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions .	6 1 4 5 6 1 7 1 57 32 1 12 6 1 10
The agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them .	6 1 4 35 19 0 1 75 0 1 4 74 40 2 13 0 1 13 1 33 11 0 1 14 17 18 87 7 23 10
Wendy Gramm , the agency 's chairman , told the Senate Agriculture Committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by Thanksgiving .	0 1 2 6 1 42 1 2 308 6 0 0 1 66 23 82 6 1 18 74 40 38 0 1 13 6 0 1 18 74 40 38 1 10
The study , by the CFTC 's division of economic analysis , shows that a trade is a trade , a member of the study team said .	6 1 2 12 6 1 42 1 12 0 1 2 65 66 6 1 11 6 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 27 10
Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis , the member said , does n't seem to have much economic impact .	55 6 1 14 40 38 6 0 13 0 1 2 6 1 44 2 1110 185 154 18 19 0 0 1 10
Currently , most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts , which makes them brokers , or for their own accounts as socalled locals .	76 2 0 1 12 0 1 48 7 1 69 12 0 1 2 445 108 23 1 2 13 12 6 0 1 112 0 1 10
The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market , Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel .	6 1 65 66 0 13 0 1 28 24 38 1 12 6 0 1 13 1 23 73 7 6 1 2 0 1 381 6 0 1 10
Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFTC operations .	1 12 1 20 121 32 0 1 38 1 18 19 0 1 10
The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system .	6 1 42 1 4 19 0 1 38 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 69 78 2 32 23 152 686 24 18 19 38 6 0 0 1 10
The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses .	6 0 1 4 134 6 1 18 19 0 1 30 6 1 4 35 77 66 6 0 1 4 19 0 1 10
So far , one test of restricting dual trading has worked well .	137 76 2 0 1 93 32 0 1 20 60 35 10
The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 .	6 0 1 11 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 42 0 0 0 1 38 1 10
Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers .	59 6 1 2 1 162 30 6 1 34 55 23 4 79 38 6 0 1 13 38 1 10
Traders who stand on the pit 's top step , where most customer orders are executed , ca n't trade for themselves .	1 33 34 38 6 1 42 0 1 2 75 0 0 1 14 40 2 4 35 79 38 23 10
A Merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit .	6 0 1 44 6 1 20 35 21 0 1 12 1 38 6 1 10
It 's too soon to tell ... but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it , he said .	23 28 29 43 18 79 106 13 1 4 35 154 18 115 53 7 23 2 23 27 10
He said he would n't comment on the CFTC plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal .	23 44 23 4 35 87 7 6 0 1 30 6 1 20 21 6 0 1 10
But at a meeting last week , Tom Donovan , the Board of Trade 's president , told commodity lawyers : Dual trading is definitely worth saving .	76 59 6 1 69 78 2 0 1 2 6 1 12 1 42 1 2 277 0 1 106 0 1 48 35 155 120 10

Toyota Motor Corp. 's Lexus division also provides specifications .	0 0 1 42 0 1 16 11 1 10
But only two-thirds of Lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the Lexus specs .	76 0 1 12 0 1 37 32 0 1 70 7 6 0 1 10
Some are even coming up with their own novel designs .	23 37 35 45 35 7 6 0 0 1 10

Dictation Device 's Saga Plays Back a Lesson	0 1 42 1 11 35 6 1
PRODUCTS DON'T have to be first to be winners .	1 544 64 18 115 24 18 19 1 10
That 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit .	23 11 6 1 40 38 0 0 1 40 38 6 0 1 10
Dictaphone Corp. was caught off guard in 1974 when its main competitor , Lanier Office Products of Japan , introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices .	0 1 14 40 38 1 38 1 75 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 1 2 11 6 0 0 1 69 92 1 112 0 0 1 10
Blocked by patent protection from following suit , Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again -- down to the length of a paperclip .	22 38 0 1 155 156 24 2 1 64 18 19 6 1 78 13 5 6 1 7 1 35 35 815 7 6 1 12 6 1 10
By 1979 , designers and engineers at Dictaphone , a Pitney Bowes subsidiary , had produced a working model of a picocassette recorder .	59 1 2 1 13 1 12 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 20 21 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
By 1982 , however , the patent status of the Lanier microcassette had changed , permitting Dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system , which it did .	59 1 2 76 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 20 60 2 229 1 18 19 6 0 0 0 1 2 471 23 11 10
Marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project .	0 13 0 1 16 11 1 12 6 0 1 10
But others said pico should proceed .	76 1 44 1 4 79 10
Both were right .	23 28 24 10
Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985 , but it has n't sold well .	1 34 35 13 11 6 1 38 1 2 13 23 20 35 60 35 10
To date , says Emil Jachmann , a Dictaphone vice president , it has broken even or shown a small loss .	59 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 23 20 164 24 13 21 6 0 1 10
Nevertheless , the device has been successful in other ways .	76 2 6 1 20 164 24 38 0 1 10
It helped Dictaphone attract better engineers , and it provided new technology for other company products .	23 282 1 19 0 1 2 13 23 73 0 1 7 0 0 1 10
The picocassette recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from follower to leading-edge innovator .	6 0 1 16 4 467 6 1 42 1 7 1 7 0 1 10
It gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in Japan look at the pico and shake his head and say unbelievable , says Mr. Jachmann .	192 1181 23 0 1 18 344 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 87 7 6 1 13 19 6 1 13 115 24 2 56 0 1 10

A Rake 's Progress Means Branching Out	6 1 42 1 37 120 35
ONE DAY Carl Barrett of Mobile , Ala. , was raking some sycamore leaves , but the rake kept riding up over the piles .	137 76 0 1 12 1 2 1 2 37 32 6 0 1 2 13 6 1 37 120 35 38 6 1 10
The harder he tried to push them into large piles , the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back .	658 24 23 64 18 19 23 38 0 1 2 109 24 23 48 155 32 6 1 13 32 6 1 10
So Mr. Barrett , then vice president of the Alabama Steamship Association , took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up .	76 0 1 2 52 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 11 6 0 0 1 13 73 23 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 0 0 1 107 10

Now incorporated into a polypropylene rake , the four-inch prongs , or wonderbars , also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves .	16 22 7 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 13 1 2 16 14 17 18 87 155 32 35 1 10
One customer , Donald Blaggs of Mobile , says the Barrett Rake allowed him to do his lawn in 2 1\/2 hours , two hours less than usual .	0 1 2 0 1 12 1 2 44 6 0 1 82 23 18 19 6 1 38 36 0 1 2 0 1 3 483 24 10
But other rake makers have their doubts .	76 0 0 1 11 6 1 10
Richard Mason , president of Ames Co. in Parkersburg , W. Va. , says the Barrett rake makes sense , but it would be tough to explain to consumers .	0 1 2 1 12 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 44 6 0 1 11 1 2 13 23 4 115 127 18 5 7 1 10
John Stoner , marketing director for True Temper Corp. , a subsidiary of Black & Decker , says people do n't want to move a leaf pile .	0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 44 1 4 35 154 18 19 6 0 1 10
They either pick it up , he says , or they start pulling from a fresh direction .	23 16 11 23 35 2 23 44 2 76 23 37 120 38 6 0 1 10
Odds and Ends	1 13 1

Nearly half of U.S. consumers say they 'll pay up to 5 % more for packaging that can be recycled or is biodegradable , according to a survey commissioned by the Michael Peters Group , a design consultant .	0 1 12 0 1 44 23 4 5 36 863 36 0 1 7 1 33 4 74 40 13 28 24 2 70 7 6 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 10
The Pentagon is a haunted house .	6 1 11 6 0 1 10
Living there for six years was really scary .	120 35 38 0 1 28 29 24 10
The ghosts of the past are everywhere : They are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget .	6 1 12 6 1 28 24 104 23 14 22 7 1 67 57 146 23 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Some can be bought off relatively cheaply .	23 4 74 40 35 67 35 10
During the Korean War , Gen. Douglas MacArthur demanded and got , in addition to his U.N. command in Korea , his own naval command in Japan , NavforJapan .	59 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 34 13 34 2 38 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10
Those obsolete operations cost less than $ 2 billion a year , and keep Mac 's ghost quiet .	6 0 1 11 24 227 86 0 9 92 1 2 13 136 1 42 1 24 10
That 's about all it costs to appease Adm. Erich Raeder 's ghost .	23 11 0 1 23 82 18 19 0 0 1 42 1 10
In 1941 , Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal , so we created the Southern Command in Panama .	59 1 2 1 13 6 0 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 2 185 23 11 6 0 1 12 1 10
The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega .	6 0 1 20 164 24 171 38 6 1 30 1 42 1 16 34 38 6 0 1 22 7 0 1 10
The Command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act 's six points , Cap Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson 's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support .	6 1 42 0 1 14 40 18 194 55 1 12 1 12 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 42 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 2 6 0 1 42 0 1 13 0 1 42 0 1 43 18 19 0 1 10

The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered in Cuba back in the '70s costs just a few hundred million : the price of the Caribbean Command in Key West that President Carter created in 1980 .	6 1 12 6 0 1 40 38 1 67 38 6 1 11 0 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 138 0 1 11 38 1 10
The brigade has n't been heard from since , but we keep the staff around just in case .	6 1 20 35 151 172 7 35 2 13 23 11 6 1 35 35 208 208 10
George Marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy .	0 1 42 1 28 29 29 43 18 115 24 10
We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon : statues , busts , relics and such .	23 11 6 1 12 1 12 23 38 6 1 106 35 2 35 2 35 13 24 10
The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him , but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 64 18 19 6 1 12 1 38 23 2 13 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 282 23 19 23 10
You see , Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines -- he wanted to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal blocked him .	23 34 2 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 13 6 1 104 23 64 18 221 23 1 12 6 1 13 0 71 6 1 0 1 11 23 10
Now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done .	76 6 1 4 35 79 35 30 23 14 40 10
To keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and Marines under it .	18 178 23 24 23 11 6 0 0 1 81 1 13 35 79 38 6 1 13 6 0 1 13 73 1 12 6 1 13 1 7 23 10
Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all -- the ghost of the shah of Iran .	548 11 35 6 0 13 0 1 12 23 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 10
When the shah died , President Carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine .	39 6 1 34 2 0 1 28 289 266 66 6 1 42 1 4 5 23 155 32 23 35 18 19 1 38 6 1 66 23 11 6 0 1 10
Mr. Carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran .	0 1 44 23 4 87 7 1 18 5 23 155 113 18 19 1 10
But that ghost would n't settle for words , he wanted money and people -- lots .	76 6 1 4 35 87 7 1 2 23 11 1 13 1 106 24 10
So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called the Rapid Deployment Force .	76 0 1 11 0 0 0 1 13 73 23 7 6 0 1 12 1 15 6 0 0 1 10
But that ghost was n't fooled ; he knew the RDF was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force -- even though it cost $ 8 billion or $ 10 billion a year .	76 6 1 14 35 40 91 23 44 6 1 28 29 24 13 24 13 6 1 203 76 293 23 11 86 0 9 13 86 0 9 92 1 10
After Mr. Carter was defeated in 1980 , the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after President Reagan and Cap Weinberger .	39 0 1 14 40 38 1 2 6 1 42 1 11 6 1 13 16 48 7 0 1 13 0 1 10
I saw what he did to them firsthand .	23 11 119 23 73 7 23 35 10
It made my shoelaces dance with terror .	23 282 6 1 79 38 1 10
Why , he used to lay in wait for Cap ; suddenly he 'd leap from behind some statue of Marshall onto Cap 's chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up an additional $ 2 billion or so .	76 2 23 64 18 87 7 1 38 1 91 76 23 4 79 70 7 6 1 12 1 38 1 42 1 13 19 23 38 6 1 13 19 23 30 23 11 35 6 0 86 0 9 13 23 10
He bought $ 4 billion in prepositioning ships and $ 7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them , and parked them at a new $ 6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean .	23 11 86 0 9 12 0 1 13 86 0 9 12 1 13 1 18 19 23 2 13 11 23 38 6 0 125 0 9 1 12 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
He dedicated all these new forces to the Persian Gulf .	23 73 52 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 10
One night both Marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught Cap and threw him to the ground .	137 76 52 1 42 1 13 6 1 42 1 24 21 1 13 21 23 38 6 1 10
Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the RDF in Tampa and renamed it Central Command .	703 23 344 23 79 23 11 36 0 1 38 6 1 12 1 13 108 23 0 1 10
He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean .	23 108 6 1 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 10
Marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers -- someday maybe they would get the whole Navy .	1 44 23 4 19 0 1 12 6 1 104 76 76 23 4 19 6 0 1 10
They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers .	23 11 1 32 6 1 35 2 13 23 65 35 66 23 20 60 67 38 0 1 10
But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains .	76 6 1 16 37 120 35 38 1 2 185 1 11 36 0 0 0 1 13 86 0 9 12 0 1 2 78 2 78 2 335 1 208 6 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 4 79 38 52 6 0 1 13 1 13 87 7 1 38 6 0 1 10
Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ?	76 76 1 42 1 64 18 79 13 586 2 76 454 1 549 23 32 45 7 6 0 1 12 1 0 1 107 10
We 'd get our asses kicked .	23 4 191 6 1 40 10
Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .	122 7 1 2 1 28 24 13 16 34 35 2 30 103 1 106 23 37 156 24 10
So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean .	76 6 1 11 23 311 0 86 0 9 12 1 7 0 0 1 7 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
We had great success in Somalia .	23 11 0 1 38 1 10
But then it turned out that President Siad Barrah was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base he promised us in Berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the Gulf .	76 76 23 65 35 66 0 0 1 11 35 68 23 6 0 1 13 6 1 65 35 66 6 1 23 108 23 12 1 20 60 35 36 36 0 1 26 13 16 11 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 10
-LRB- But who 's counting . -RRB-	166 76 246 37 120 10 167
Still , Berbera was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with President Barrah .	76 2 1 11 6 1 23 4 19 2 185 23 34 38 1 38 0 1 10
All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway .	52 6 1 237 23 32 1 28 35 24 35 10
But would n't you know , now that we are spending jillions of dollars , and have built those new divisions and new air wings , and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the Russians in Iran , the Russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject .	76 515 185 23 79 2 137 39 23 37 32 1 12 1 2 13 20 21 6 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 13 20 195 52 6 1 13 1 18 19 6 1 38 1 2 6 1 64 18 163 21 1 12 6 0 1 10
Meanwhile , Congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget .	76 2 1 37 111 0 1 161 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Predictably , some Navy guys said : Do we still need to keep all 18 Army divisions on active duty and all those extra land-based aircraft without bases and all those Army guys playing admiral in Tampa ?	76 2 6 0 1 249 106 244 23 185 154 18 19 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 13 52 6 0 0 1 12 1 13 52 6 0 1 32 1 38 1 10
Could n't we save $ 20 billion or $ 30 billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves ?	244 185 23 19 86 0 9 13 86 0 9 92 1 57 111 6 1 7 6 1 10
And why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by abolishing Central Command and putting responsibility for Gulf naval operations back where it belongs , afloat with the task force commander in the Gulf ?	76 712 185 19 6 1 12 36 0 1 57 32 0 1 13 327 1 12 0 0 1 24 47 23 34 2 53 7 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
And where were all our handsomely paid Indian Ocean allies last year when our convoys were being attacked ?	76 1186 242 52 6 36 0 0 0 1 491 185 1203 6 1 37 182 40 10
Questions like that really stir up Marshall 's ghost .	1 12 23 16 11 35 1 42 1 10
He appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary , Dick Cheney .	23 34 67 67 35 38 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 0 1 10
Marshall came clanking in like Marley 's ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with Arab despots .	1 37 45 35 7 1 42 1 32 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 13 1 12 0 1 10
He would n't leave until Mr. Cheney promised to do whatever the Pentagon systems analysts told him .	23 4 35 79 30 0 1 64 18 19 119 6 0 0 1 108 23 10
So next day Mr. Cheney went out and did just that : He canceled the 600-ship Navy and cut back one carrier and 20 frigates .	76 137 76 0 1 28 24 13 11 0 1 104 23 11 6 0 1 13 436 24 0 1 13 0 1 10
Then he canceled production of the Navy 's most important carrier aircraft , the F-14 and the A-6 .	76 23 11 1 12 6 1 42 36 0 0 1 2 6 1 13 6 1 10
On the other hand , Mr. Cheney retained all those new land forces .	59 6 0 1 2 0 1 11 52 6 0 0 1 10
Marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now , but he 'll be back .	1 42 1 28 24 140 24 2 13 23 4 115 24 10
What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming , more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks .	137 913 1 120 13 0 0 1 120 2 0 13 0 0 1 37 120 38 6 1 10
They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships .	23 65 66 23 4 19 35 6 1 67 81 0 1 123 57 32 1 13 1 10
Then the whole thing will start to collapse , just as it did in the 1970s , and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people 's hair white .	76 6 0 1 4 154 18 79 2 67 30 23 34 38 6 1 2 13 6 1 13 1 4 168 120 38 6 1 327 1 42 1 24 10
Gives me the willies just thinking about it .	108 23 6 1 16 45 7 23 10
Mr. Lehman , a Reagan Navy secretary , is a managing director of PaineWebber .	0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 12 1 10
The metal and marble lobby of CenTrust Bank 's headquarters is grander than your average savings and loan .	6 1 13 0 1 12 0 1 42 1 28 24 84 6 0 1 13 1 10
For one thing , there is an old master on the wall -- Samuel Anointing David , a big baroque canvas painted by Mattia Preti , a 17th-century Neapolitan .	59 0 1 2 50 51 6 0 1 38 6 1 38 1 32 1 2 6 0 0 1 40 38 0 1 2 6 0 1 10
At the moment , however , the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive , David L. Paul .	59 6 1 2 76 2 6 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 33 20 21 1 13 6 0 1 13 0 1 2 0 0 1 10
In an international buying spree that began barely two years ago , Mr. Paul amassed a collection of about 30 pre-18th-century works , including the Preti , at a total cost of $ 28 million .	59 6 0 0 1 33 34 36 0 1 26 2 0 1 11 6 1 12 36 0 0 1 2 12 6 1 2 38 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 10
By midnight Oct. 6 , all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off , under orders from Florida 's comptroller , whose office regulates the state 's S&Ls .	59 0 86 9 2 23 12 6 1 14 17 18 163 151 40 35 2 38 1 12 1 42 1 2 135 1 11 6 1 42 1 10
CenTrust did n't meet the deadline .	1 4 35 19 6 1 10
The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S&L 's new office tower , designed by I.M. Pei .	6 1 48 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 0 1 11 12 124 6 1 64 18 19 0 1 106 12 6 1 12 1 13 12 1 12 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 40 38 0 1 10
The rub is that the $ 28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist .	6 1 65 66 6 86 0 9 14 22 7 6 1 12 6 36 0 1 67 30 1 37 32 1 35 68 1 10
Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S&L in the first place -- it is n't on the comptroller 's permissible list -- without seeking a special dispensation , which he did not do .	0 1 11 6 1 18 19 1 38 6 1 38 6 0 1 30 23 48 35 7 6 1 42 0 1 106 57 32 6 0 1 2 471 23 4 35 19 10
Besides that , some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of CenTrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on La Gorce Isle off Miami Beach .	59 23 2 23 12 6 1 33 64 18 19 6 1 12 1 16 34 35 120 38 6 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
Last spring , the comptroller 's office called a halt to Mr. Paul 's fling , giving him six months to sell the paintings .	137 76 2 6 1 42 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 42 1 2 146 23 0 1 18 19 6 1 10
The acquisitions , officials said in a letter to Mr. Paul , were unsafe , unsound and unauthorized .	6 1 2 1 44 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 28 24 2 24 13 24 10
So far , Mr. Paul has unloaded but three of his masterpieces , he wo n't say to whom .	137 76 2 0 1 20 21 0 1 12 6 1 2 23 4 35 79 12 1349 10

Despite Mr. Paul 's characteristic hauteur , the 50-year-old , chain-smoking dynamo is finding that getting CenTrust -- Florida 's largest thrift institution -- out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been .	59 0 1 42 0 1 2 6 0 2 0 1 37 207 66 111 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 106 161 7 6 0 1 28 29 24 47 45 7 23 20 60 10

Divesting itself of what is left , as is required of all thrift institutions by July 1994 under the new federal S&L bailout law , may well prove difficult .	111 23 7 118 14 40 2 972 14 22 7 6 0 1 38 1 123 38 6 0 0 0 0 1 2 4 35 115 24 10

The art collection might have come to rival the Medicis ' had the Florida comptroller 's office not got wind of Mr. Paul 's aesthetic adventure .	6 0 1 4 163 94 18 19 6 0 1 541 6 0 1 42 1 16 21 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 10
In its letter to him , dated March 2 and shared with reporters , Alex Hager , the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the comptroller 's office , expressed puzzlement that the S&L could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million in its two preceding quarters .	59 6 1 12 23 2 40 8 9 13 22 7 1 2 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 2 11 80 66 6 1 4 115 29 24 30 23 20 21 1 12 24 227 86 0 9 38 6 0 0 1 10
The state gave CenTrust 30 days to sell the Rubens .	6 1 108 1 0 1 18 19 6 1 10
The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands , ordering that the book value of the collection -LCB- be -RCB- reduced to zero .	6 1 42 1 16 73 6 1 7 0 1 13 11 6 1 2 207 262 6 0 1 12 6 1 166 74 167 22 7 1 10
In other words : Get rid of all the pictures .	85 0 1 106 115 53 7 52 6 1 10
The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul : Govern yourself accordingly .	6 1 16 65 66 0 0 1 11 1 93 32 6 1 13 1 13 48 7 6 1 12 0 1 238 19 23 35 10
The state agency was particularly vexed to learn that the Rubens and a half-dozen other paintings listed among the bank 's furniture and fixtures , were actually hanging in the chairman 's house .	6 0 1 14 16 17 18 77 66 6 1 13 6 0 0 1 40 38 6 1 42 1 13 1 2 37 35 120 38 6 1 42 1 10

He explains that he was merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment required for their safekeeping , until CenTrust 's new building was ready for them .	23 65 66 23 37 16 32 6 1 38 1 106 38 6 1 106 70 7 6 0 0 1 40 38 6 1 2 30 1 42 0 1 28 53 7 23 10
Still , the incident was embarrassing .	76 2 6 1 28 24 10
It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr. Paul has benefited handsomely from his association with CenTrust .	23 34 38 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 1 207 66 0 1 20 169 35 7 6 1 12 1 10

He owns 43 % of CenTrust 's shares .	23 11 0 1 12 1 42 1 10
Adding to Mr. Paul 's problems , dealers -LRB- some with vested interests -RRB- insist that he , relying rather too heavily on Sotheby 's advice , paid much too much for several pieces in the CenTrust collection .	45 7 0 1 42 1 2 1 12 23 12 0 1 167 65 66 23 2 45 67 67 35 7 1 42 1 2 73 0 0 1 7 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The $ 12 million lavished on the Rubens , for example , was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among scholars about its provenance .	6 86 0 9 22 7 6 1 2 85 1 2 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 13 52 52 6 1 2 12 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 10
David Tunick , the president of David Tunick Inc. , a New York gallery , says scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens .	0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 44 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 10
It may have been painted instead by a Rubens associate .	23 4 163 151 40 35 38 6 0 1 10
The feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event , Mr. Tunick says .	6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 65 66 6 1 40 38 6 1 28 24 38 6 1 2 0 1 27 10
It sounds like with the Rubens he got absolutely taken to the cleaners .	23 48 273 59 6 1 23 14 16 22 7 6 1 10
Victor Wiener , the executive director of the Appraisers Association of America , agrees that Mr. Paul paid very dearly for the Rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat .	0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 65 66 0 1 48 67 35 7 6 1 13 65 66 156 53 7 23 6 1 26 38 6 0 1 4 19 52 6 1 10
It 's not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth $ 12 million , but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen .	192 1351 35 7 1 6 1 4 35 115 126 86 0 9 2 13 55 23 4 74 22 7 6 1 35 796 18 74 40 10

CREATIVE ACCOUNTING , mostly by conglomerates , forced CPAs to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results , standards that had become all too flexible .	0 1 2 69 12 1 2 82 1 18 19 6 1 93 32 1 18 74 40 38 1 32 0 1 2 1 33 20 164 29 29 24 10

The climate was right for the new FASB .	6 1 28 24 38 6 0 1 10
In the late 1960s some CPAs failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices .	59 6 0 1 6 1 64 18 19 52 1 237 1 32 0 1 33 11 1 13 0 1 10

Analysts on average had been expecting about $ 2.70 for Alcoa and $ 1 for Alcan .	1 85 1 20 121 32 0 86 9 12 1 13 86 9 12 1 10
It 's a good indication that level of profitability has peaked for the industry , says Vahid Fathi , metals analyst with Prescott , Ball & Turben Inc. , who had estimated Reynolds would earn about $ 2.35 a share .	23 11 6 0 80 66 1 12 1 20 60 38 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 33 20 173 1 4 19 0 86 9 92 1 10
The nation 's No. 2 aluminum company said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain fabricated aluminum products , which typically follow price fluctuations of primary ingots .	6 1 42 0 0 0 1 44 1 14 40 38 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 33 16 11 0 1 12 0 1 10
The base metal price has dropped 30.3 % from a year earlier to 78 cents a pound .	6 0 0 1 20 60 67 35 140 6 1 3 38 0 1 92 1 10
Much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry 's slowest period .	1 12 6 0 1 20 151 22 7 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 11 35 6 1 42 0 1 10
But William O. Bourke , chairman and chief executive officer , said the ingot price appears to have bottomed out .	76 0 0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 2 44 6 0 1 64 18 163 60 35 10
He said shipments are continuing at a healthy pace and the company has no excess inventory .	23 44 1 37 120 38 6 0 1 13 6 1 11 6 0 1 10
Aluminum shipments of 329,600 metric tons were nearly equal to the year-earlier period , the company said .	0 1 12 0 0 1 28 29 53 7 6 0 1 2 6 1 27 10
Nevertheless , the company said that in the latest quarter there were increased material and labor costs , including a new employee profit-sharing plan .	76 2 6 1 65 66 59 6 0 1 50 51 0 0 13 0 1 2 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Reynolds closed at $ 55.375 , up $ 1.25 .	59 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 1 48 7 86 9 2 38 86 9 10
No strikeout , but certainly no home run .	6 1 2 13 52 6 0 1 10
That 's how the stock-picking game is shaping up for the months ahead , according to money managers and a few brokers .	23 162 55 6 0 1 37 120 35 38 6 1 123 2 70 7 0 1 13 6 0 1 10
Yesterday 's 88-point recovery from Friday 's megadrop in the Dow Jones industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again .	1 42 0 1 12 1 42 1 12 6 0 0 1 11 0 0 1 207 66 1 11 6 0 1 35 10
But quite a few money managers are n't buying it .	76 52 6 0 0 1 37 35 32 23 10
Weakening corporate earnings , they say , are no prescription for a bull market .	0 0 1 2 23 44 2 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
The stock market ai n't going to do much of anything for a while , says John Neff of Wellington Management , who runs the $ 8.3 billion Windsor Fund .	6 0 1 37 35 113 18 19 1 12 23 38 6 1 2 56 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 11 6 125 0 9 0 1 10
He suspects that Friday 's market decline may have a second leg , perhaps a 10 % to 15 % drop later on .	23 65 66 1 42 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 2 52 6 88 36 863 36 0 1 67 35 10
Mr. Neff says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces , namely earnings growth and the LBO sweepstakes -- buy-out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks , such as media and airlines .	0 1 44 6 0 1 20 21 6 0 0 1 2 52 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 33 82 1 18 19 35 0 1 12 1 2 69 12 1 13 1 10
After sitting with 20 % of his fund in cash before Friday 's sell-off , Mr. Neff says he bought a narrow list of stocks yesterday .	181 120 38 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 38 1 42 1 2 0 1 44 23 11 6 0 1 12 1 35 10
With flat corporate profits on the horizon for 1990 , money managers say price-earnings multiples that look cheap today might go on being cheap for a long time .	59 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 0 1 44 0 1 33 28 24 35 4 168 35 156 24 38 6 0 1 10
This is not a grossly overvalued market , but it 's not cheap either , says George Collins , president of the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore .	23 11 35 6 36 0 1 2 13 23 28 35 24 35 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 0 1 69 69 69 78 112 1 10
According to Institutional Brokers Estimate System , Wall Street market strategists see only a 2.4 % jump in company profits in 1990 -- unlike in 1987 , when profits a year out looked good -LRB- they did soar 36 % in 1988 -RRB- .	122 7 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 11 52 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 106 24 84 1 2 75 1 149 1 24 28 24 104 23 4 79 67 35 38 1 167 10
Bulls say the market is an incredible bargain , priced at only about 12 times estimated 1989 earnings for stocks in the Standard & Poor 's 500 index .	1 44 6 1 11 6 0 1 2 22 7 62 52 52 6 0 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 1 42 0 1 10
Before the 1987 crash , the P\/E was more than 20 .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 11 24 227 1 10
The common view , says Abby Cohen , strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , is that there will be mild economic growth , modest profit expansion , and things are going to be hunky-dory .	6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 2 65 66 50 190 19 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 13 1 37 113 18 115 24 10
Our view is that we may see a profit decline .	6 1 65 66 23 4 19 6 0 1 10
Some think investors should sell into rallies .	23 44 1 4 87 7 1 10
The market is going to wind down , says Gerald W. Perritt , a Chicago money manager .	6 1 37 113 18 79 35 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 10
Things are a little less overpriced after Friday 's jolt in the market .	1 28 422 1 29 24 38 1 42 1 12 6 1 10
He expects stocks to decline an additional 5 % to 30 % , with the Dow perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 between now and June .	23 82 1 18 19 6 36 0 1 38 0 1 2 31 6 1 16 120 35 38 1 13 1 140 24 13 1 10
After Friday 's decline , Mr. Perritt 's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks , using old-fashioned value criteria devised by Benjamin Graham , an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis .	59 1 42 1 2 0 1 42 1 73 0 1 7 0 0 1 2 32 0 0 1 40 38 0 1 2 6 1 13 1 12 6 1 13 1 33 28 29 43 18 19 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
He found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued .	23 11 1 16 40 13 1 16 40 10
Nicholas Parks , a New York money manager , expects the market to decline about 15 % .	0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 2 82 6 1 18 79 96 67 35 10
I 've been two-thirds in cash since July , and I continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate , he says .	23 20 21 1 12 1 38 1 2 13 23 64 18 77 66 32 6 0 1 28 24 2 23 27 10
Companies that piled on debt in leveraged buy-outs during the past two years will continue to surface as business problems .	1 33 11 35 1 38 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 4 154 18 87 7 0 1 10
Generalizations about value are n't useful , says New York money manager John LeFrere of Delta Capital Management .	1 12 1 28 35 24 2 56 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
For instance , he says , International Business Machines and Unisys might look cheap , but investors might continue to do better with stocks like Walt Disney , Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola , strong performers in recent years .	59 1 2 23 44 2 0 0 1 13 1 4 115 24 2 13 1 4 154 18 87 35 7 1 12 0 1 2 0 0 1 13 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 10
Money manager Robert Ross , head of Duncan Ross Associates Ltd. in Vancouver , British Columbia , says stocks would have to fall 15 % to 20 % before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives .	0 0 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 44 1 4 154 18 79 67 81 652 81 1 30 23 28 53 7 0 0 0 1 10
Fredric Russell , a money manager in Tulsa , Okla. , says Friday 's cave-in is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than Wall Street would want to admit .	0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 2 1 2 44 1 42 1 37 113 18 115 53 7 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 47 0 1 4 154 18 79 10
There are still bulls out there .	50 51 35 1 67 35 10
I still think we will have a 3000 Dow , whether it 's six months or 12 months from now I do n't know , says David Dreman , managing partner of Dreman Value Management in New York .	23 16 44 23 4 19 6 0 1 2 55 23 11 0 1 13 0 1 12 1 23 724 185 79 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
We 're doing a little buying in some stocks that have really been smashed down .	23 37 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 33 20 35 151 40 35 10
Many brokerage house officials also are optimistic .	0 0 0 1 16 28 24 10
Yesterday , Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks .	76 2 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 78 11 6 1 12 1 23 44 1 73 7 1 10
Some investors say Friday 's sell-off was a good thing , because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation .	6 1 44 1 42 1 11 6 0 1 2 30 23 11 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
It was a healthy cleansing , says Michael Holland , who runs Salomon Brothers Asset Management in New York .	23 11 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 33 11 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
From here out , these investors see a return to old-fashioned investing , based on a company 's ability to show profit growth .	109 29 24 2 6 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 2 22 7 6 1 42 1 18 19 0 1 10
The fundamentals are pretty strong , Mr. Dreman says .	6 1 28 29 24 2 0 1 27 10
I do n't see this as a bear market at all .	23 4 35 5 23 7 6 0 1 38 23 10
It 's a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the LBO market .	23 11 6 80 66 50 51 36 36 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
Friday 's big fall was just a blunder by the stock market , says John Connolly , chief strategist for Dean Witter .	1 42 0 1 11 52 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 10
It was an overreaction to an event -LCB- the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of UAL -RCB- that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks .	23 11 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 13 0 1 18 19 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 167 33 4 35 5 6 1 7 1 12 1 10
Many investors have nagging worries , however .	0 1 11 0 1 2 35 10
Newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans .	1 28 53 7 1 12 1 45 7 6 1 13 1 32 35 0 0 1 10
That hurts investors ' confidence in the economy and stocks .	23 11 1 42 1 12 6 1 13 1 10
Not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead .	52 52 52 6 0 1 11 0 1 35 10
Disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters , says Mary Farrell , a market strategist at PaineWebber .	0 1 28 43 18 115 24 38 6 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 10
She thinks the market could drop about 10 % in the next few months , then recover and go higher .	23 44 6 1 4 79 96 67 35 38 6 0 0 1 2 16 79 13 79 35 10
Companies with steady earnings growth could do well , she says , while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10 % .	1 12 0 0 1 4 79 35 2 23 44 2 30 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 4 215 6 1 34 29 24 304 67 35 10
The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains , investment bankers and retailers said .	6 1 12 0 1 4 19 6 1 113 18 19 0 1 12 6 0 13 0 1 2 0 1 13 1 27 10
Managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies .	1 12 0 1 20 174 38 0 1 66 23 64 18 87 7 6 1 10
The chains include Bloomingdale 's , owned by Campeau Corp. , Toronto ; Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's , owned by B.A.T Industries PLC , London ; and B. Altman & Co. and Sakowitz Inc. , owned by Hooker Corp. , which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator .	6 1 11 0 1 2 40 38 0 1 2 78 91 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 40 38 0 0 1 2 78 91 13 0 0 0 1 13 0 1 2 40 38 0 1 2 33 37 35 182 40 38 6 0 0 1 10
Hooker is based in Sydney , Australia .	1 14 40 38 1 2 1 10
The combination of so many chains available for sale , the recent failures of such retailing LBO 's as Miller & Rhoads Inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices , retailing observers said .	6 1 12 0 0 1 24 84 1 2 6 0 1 12 52 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 4 19 35 1 2 0 1 27 10
The pricing will become more realistic , which should help management , said Bruce Rosenthal , a New York investment banker with Nathan S. Jonas & Co .	6 1 4 115 29 24 2 90 4 19 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 10
Investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs , but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense , either .	1 37 35 113 18 168 111 1 7 23 12 6 0 1 2 13 32 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 16 11 1 2 35 10
Earlier this year , bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales , Mr. Rosenthal added .	137 103 1 2 1 13 0 1 28 43 18 19 1 30 23 44 50 190 19 0 1 12 6 1 13 1 2 0 1 27 10
Those days are over now , he believes .	6 1 28 24 35 2 23 27 10
Competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue , added Mr. Rosenthal .	1 12 0 1 33 11 1 13 28 43 18 79 20 35 60 13 4 79 2 56 0 1 10
But when prices were crazy , it was even harder to do an LBO .	76 39 1 28 24 2 23 28 29 43 18 19 6 1 10
Bankers believed in the greater-fool theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more .	1 48 7 6 0 1 33 44 23 78 28 35 43 18 19 1 10
This is no longer true today .	23 28 67 35 24 35 10
At Saks Fifth Avenue , Paul Leblang , senior vice president , marketing , agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed LBO .	59 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 1 2 65 66 0 1 4 5 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 10
Having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage , said Mr. Leblang .	113 18 19 35 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 2 56 0 1 10
It would also help us in our search for equity partners .	23 4 35 5 23 7 6 1 12 0 1 10
To make an LBO work , now we are going to need more than just junk bonds .	18 215 6 1 34 2 76 23 37 113 18 19 1 12 0 0 1 10
None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete , especially at B. Altman & Co. , which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .	1 44 6 0 0 1 4 115 127 18 19 2 67 38 0 0 0 1 2 33 48 7 0 0 0 1 10
Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation .	137 523 529 6 0 0 1 19 0 1 30 1 11 1 12 6 1 2 76 0 0 1 28 43 18 19 36 0 1 13 0 0 0 1 10
Further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments .	76 2 0 1 16 32 0 1 42 0 1 4 115 43 18 19 0 0 1 10
It 's called bad money driving out good money , said one retailing observer .	23 20 345 0 1 32 35 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 10
Institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned .	1 33 16 11 0 1 64 18 115 29 24 10
However , the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt .	76 2 6 0 1 6 0 1 14 35 17 18 19 4 178 23 393 198 1 18 19 6 0 1 13 19 35 6 0 1 10
In addition , the fall selling season has generally been a good one , especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues .	59 1 2 6 0 0 1 20 35 21 6 0 1 2 67 38 6 1 24 84 0 1 84 6 1 12 6 1 10
What 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values , said Joseph E. Brooks , chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc. , a specialty chain .	118 28 53 7 23 65 66 0 1 4 74 40 38 6 1 12 6 1 13 1 2 52 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 10
Retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies .	1 33 11 0 0 1 93 32 1 4 19 6 0 1 18 19 35 6 1 10
Still , most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing LBOs will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds , a market already in tumult , in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the Federated and Allied units of Campeau .	76 2 0 0 1 65 66 52 6 0 0 1 4 87 35 7 6 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 69 12 1 2 295 1 230 7 1 22 7 1 40 38 6 0 13 0 1 12 1 10
Prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week , which will help management , said Gilbert Harrison , chairman of Financo Inc. , an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions .	1 12 0 1 28 126 1 47 23 34 67 35 2 90 4 19 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 45 7 0 1 10
But the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved .	76 6 1 12 1 16 64 18 74 40 10

A federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $ 1 billion in costs from controversial take-or-pay contracts .	6 0 0 1 11 35 6 0 1 33 20 139 0 1 155 606 7 1 1 12 86 0 9 12 1 12 0 0 1 10
The court , in a 3-0 ruling , threw out a deadline set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use .	6 1 2 85 6 0 1 2 11 35 6 1 40 38 6 0 0 0 1 93 32 0 0 1 12 1 1354 6 0 1 21 13 328 35 19 10
A majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts .	6 1 12 0 1 14 40 38 6 1 13 40 38 0 1 10
But pipeline companies estimate they still face $ 2.4 billion in liabilities from unresolved disputes , including $ 1 billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers .	76 0 1 44 23 16 11 86 0 9 12 1 12 0 1 2 12 86 0 9 23 1342 23 4 35 115 43 18 87 35 7 1 10
According to industry lawyers , the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism .	122 7 0 1 2 6 1 108 0 1 6 0 0 1 18 19 0 1 13 5 1 7 6 0 1 10
The court left open whether FERC could reimpose a new deadline later .	6 1 162 35 55 1 4 19 6 0 1 35 10
The court , agreeing with pipeline companies , found the March 31 deadline was arbitrary and capricious and highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take-or-pay contracts to meet the deadline .	6 1 2 45 7 0 1 2 44 6 0 0 1 28 24 13 24 13 29 53 7 6 0 1 12 1 33 14 17 18 19 1 12 6 0 0 1 18 19 6 1 10
A report last month by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America found that pipelines ' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to 39 cents on the dollar , from 22 cents on the dollar in 1988 .	6 1 69 78 12 6 0 0 0 1 12 1 65 66 1 42 0 1 20 60 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 38 0 1 12 6 1 2 38 0 1 12 6 1 68 1 10
The court ordered FERC to justify within 60 days not only its cost-sharing deadline , but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation .	6 1 82 1 18 19 38 0 1 62 52 6 0 1 2 13 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 93 111 0 1 7 0 1 10
The court also questioned a crediting mechanism that could be used to resolve take-or-pay liabilities .	6 1 16 11 6 0 1 33 4 74 17 18 19 0 1 10
The complex regulation , known in the industry as Order 500 , has been hotly contested by all sides , including natural-gas producers , pipelines , local distribution companies and consumers .	6 0 1 2 22 38 6 1 7 1 123 2 20 151 16 40 38 6 1 2 12 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 1 13 1 10
The court 's decision would allow FERC to change some of its provisions , but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the court .	6 1 42 1 4 134 1 18 19 23 12 6 1 2 13 44 23 4 74 40 35 35 38 6 1 10

As stocks rose , in fact , some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders .	39 1 34 2 59 1 2 6 1 11 1 13 11 6 0 1 10
Many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading .	0 1 82 1 18 19 1 38 6 1 12 1 10
At Scudder and at the smaller Ivy funds group in Hingham , Mass. , for instance , some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds , but later called back to reverse the switches .	59 1 13 59 6 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 2 12 1 2 6 1 34 67 38 6 1 18 19 1 38 0 1 38 0 0 1 2 13 16 34 35 18 19 6 1 10
Because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close -- in this case , at 4 p.m. -- these shareholders effectively stayed put .	39 0 0 1 4 35 19 1 38 6 1 123 106 12 6 1 2 12 1 123 106 6 1 16 34 35 10
At Fidelity 's office in downtown Boston , Gerald Sherman walked in shortly after 7:30 a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund .	59 1 42 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 34 35 67 38 1 123 13 11 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 70 7 0 0 1 13 38 6 0 0 1 10

Much of the money has been switched into money market funds , fund executives say .	1 12 6 1 20 151 40 38 0 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
Instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions , however , some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests .	122 155 32 1 18 19 1 2 76 2 6 1 20 169 7 1 18 19 0 1 10
This avoids knocking down prices further .	23 37 32 35 1 35 10

a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic , not unheroic , though sadly self-deceived English butler in his sixties -- proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners , like Britannia herself , still ruled the waves .	267 0 1 153 6 0 2 29 24 2 210 29 24 0 1 12 6 1 268 34 203 293 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 85 1 78 2 16 11 6 1 10
In fact , Kazuo Ishiguro 's The Remains of the Day -LRB- Knopf , 245 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them .	59 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 217 6 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 86 9 167 11 52 6 1 12 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 23 10
It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects ' minds , manners and morals , and argues , tacitly , that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery , willful blindness , role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants .	23 65 66 6 0 1 14 22 7 6 1 42 1 2 1 13 1 2 13 65 2 35 2 66 6 0 1 14 22 7 6 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 13 52 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
As the narrator Stevens , the solitary butler of Darlington Hall , mulls over such hallowed terms as greatness , dignity , service and loyalty , we see how pious cant subverts the soul .	39 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 48 7 52 0 1 12 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 2 23 162 55 0 1 11 6 1 10

As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from Oxfordshire to Cornwall , where a former housekeeper resides , perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage , perhaps -LRB- he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge -RRB- not disinclined to return to domestic service , Stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait , a credo and the author 's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we 're reading :	39 23 34 38 6 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 12 1 2 75 6 0 1 34 2 52 6 1 12 6 0 1 123 2 29 1276 23 34 38 0 1 75 23 4 35 79 167 29 43 18 87 7 0 1 2 1 11 6 1 13 16 11 6 1 2 6 1 13 6 1 42 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 23 37 32 106
We call this land of ours Great Britain , and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice .	23 108 6 1 12 1 0 1 2 13 50 190 19 23 33 108 23 6 36 0 1 10
Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective ... .	76 23 4 77 66 6 1 12 6 1 78 4 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 106 10
It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart .	192 233 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 33 136 6 1 12 6 1 24 10
What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty , its sense of restraint .	118 28 24 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 12 1 10
It is as though the land knows of its own beauty , of its own greatness , and feels no need to shout it .	23 291 292 293 6 1 48 7 6 0 1 2 7 6 0 1 2 13 11 6 1 18 19 23 10
In comparison , the sorts of sights offered in such places as Africa and America , though undoubtedly very exciting , would , I am sure , strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness .	59 1 2 6 1 12 1 40 38 52 1 12 1 13 1 2 78 29 29 24 2 4 2 23 28 24 2 5 6 0 1 46 24 38 1 12 6 0 1 10
An effusive landscape ?	6 0 1 10
An ill-mannered mountain ?	6 0 1 10
But let Stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner -LRB- his conscious efforts at banter always fail -- most comically -RRB- : This whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years : what is a great butler ?	16 344 1 79 38 6 0 0 1 1358 6 0 1 12 1 16 79 140 29 24 167 30 6 0 1 28 29 53 7 6 1 33 20 21 0 1 38 6 1 38 6 1 400 246 11 6 0 1 10
His answer is one possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position .	6 1 11 1 22 7 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 10
Such dignity has to do crucially with a butler 's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits .	52 1 64 18 87 35 7 6 1 42 1 16 18 19 6 0 1 23 11 10
He will not be shaken out by external events , however surprising , alarming or vexing ... .	23 4 35 74 40 35 38 0 1 2 29 24 2 24 13 24 106 10
Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of .	1 28 43 18 19 1 30 23 28 38 6 1 53 7 6 0 1 138 52 6 0 1 28 53 7 10
Despite his racial advantage , to be a great butler is a heroic calling ; one 's pantry is not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle .	59 6 0 1 2 18 19 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 91 23 42 1 48 161 7 1 42 1 12 6 1 10
If , for example , in the midst of a great social occasion -LRB- such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923 -RRB- , one 's 72-yearold father , himself a great butler once , should happen to die of a stroke , one must continue to serve the port : Please do n't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment .	39 2 59 1 2 59 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 166 69 12 6 0 1 93 32 6 0 1 12 1 167 2 23 42 0 1 2 23 92 0 1 78 2 4 154 18 87 7 6 1 2 23 4 154 18 19 6 1 90 16 4 35 178 23 29 53 155 16 113 18 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 67 38 6 1 10
You see , I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now .	23 34 2 23 44 6 1 4 163 195 23 18 79 35 67 35 10
It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare : For all its sad associations , whenever I recall that evening today , I find I do so with a large sense of triumph .	23 11 6 1 12 1 13 1 33 82 1 18 215 106 59 6 78 0 1 2 39 23 11 6 1 35 2 23 44 23 28 24 38 6 0 1 12 1 10
We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow .	23 11 6 0 0 1 17 18 19 0 1 13 1 10
That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent , but funny and sad and enlightening , is entirely the author 's triumph .	1 1 78 28 29 24 13 24 2 13 24 13 24 13 24 2 11 35 6 1 42 1 10
Mr. Ishiguro 's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic , cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel , An Artist of the Floating World , set in Japan after the war .	0 1 42 1 18 19 6 0 0 1 33 82 23 18 19 52 0 0 2 0 13 0 1 28 29 24 38 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 40 38 1 38 6 1 10
Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly 30 years , he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster .	76 32 6 1 38 6 1 23 11 38 1 38 6 1 23 20 169 7 38 36 0 1 2 23 20 21 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 10
With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and -LRB- utterly repressed -RRB- sexual love , but British anti-Semitism , the gentry 's impatience with democracy and support of Hitler , and the moral problematics of loyalty : It is , in practice , simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service ... .	59 0 1 23 11 62 52 0 1 13 662 29 24 167 0 1 2 13 0 1 2 6 1 42 1 217 1 13 1 217 1 2 13 6 0 1 12 1 75 23 28 2 38 1 2 29 29 43 18 19 52 6 0 1 38 6 1 13 85 6 0 1 19 0 1 106 10
This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable .	6 1 11 23 138 23 136 24 13 24 10
I will hereafter devote myself to serving him .	23 4 35 5 23 155 32 23 10
This is loyalty intelligently bestowed .	23 11 1 16 40 10
In the end , after meeting with the former housekeeper , Stevens sits by the seashore at dusk , thinking of her and of his employer , and declares I trusted .	59 6 1 2 181 45 7 6 0 1 2 1 34 38 6 1 38 1 2 45 7 23 13 7 6 1 2 13 44 23 34 10
I trusted in his lordship 's wisdom ... .	23 48 7 6 1 42 1 106 10
I ca n't even say I made my own mistakes .	23 4 35 35 215 23 11 6 0 1 10
Really -- one has to ask oneself -- what dignity is there in that ?	76 106 23 64 18 19 23 1285 454 1 1047 50 153 23 10
The loyal servant has come full circle .	6 0 1 20 60 67 35 10
What is greatness ?	420 405 1 10
What is dignity ?	420 405 1 10
We understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective : The owl of Minerva only spreads her wings at dusk .	23 215 52 0 1 4 115 24 104 6 1 12 1 16 11 6 1 38 1 10
But as The Remains of the Day so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity , such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art .	76 39 6 1 12 6 1 72 16 34 38 0 1 2 52 1 4 74 16 22 7 1 10

In his office overlooking the runway of Shannon Airport , Mr. Ovcharenko enthusiastically throws out what he calls just ideas :	59 6 1 32 6 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 16 11 35 119 23 108 0 1 106
First , he suggests , GPA Group Ltd. , the international aircraft leasing company based in Ireland , could lease some of its Boeing jetliners to the Soviet airline .	76 2 23 44 2 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 40 38 1 2 4 5 23 12 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 10
Then Aer Lingus , the Irish flag carrier , could teach Aeroflot pilots to fly the Boeings , and the fleet could be based here at Shannon Airport .	76 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 4 134 0 1 18 19 6 1 2 13 6 1 4 74 40 35 38 0 1 10
That 's not all , he says .	23 11 35 23 2 23 27 10
Aer Rianta , the Irish airport authority , could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union .	0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 4 19 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
Aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to Aer Lingus , through GPA , for a joint-venture cargo airline .	1 4 5 23 12 6 0 1 7 0 1 2 38 1 2 38 6 0 0 1 10
And then there is his notion of an Irish-Soviet charter airline to ferry Armenians to Los Angeles via Shannon .	76 76 50 51 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 18 19 1 38 0 1 38 1 10
Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr. Ovcharenko 's head ?	803 6 1 12 1 169 7 0 1 42 1 10
Hardly .	24 10
The Irish-Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport .	6 0 0 1 28 24 13 24 35 38 0 1 10
GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s .	1 37 35 45 155 111 0 1 7 1 13 161 155 32 0 0 1 10
Aer Lingus is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities .	0 1 48 7 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 10
Aer Rianta already has so many ventures with Aeroflot that its chief executive is studying Russian .	0 1 16 11 0 0 1 12 1 75 6 0 1 37 32 1 10
Unlikely as it may seem , tiny , politically neutral Ireland has penetrated the mighty Soviet airline bureaucracy .	24 47 23 4 79 2 0 2 36 0 1 20 21 6 0 0 0 1 10
And as Aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards , upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities , the Irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit .	76 39 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 2 19 6 1 13 19 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 20 94 18 79 10
Irish and Soviet people are similar , says Mr. Ovcharenko .	0 13 0 1 28 24 2 56 0 1 10
They look the same .	23 11 6 1 10
They 're very friendly .	23 28 29 24 10
Moreover , he says , Irish companies are small but spunky .	76 2 23 44 2 0 1 28 24 13 24 10
We have to study their experience very well , he says .	23 64 18 19 6 1 67 35 2 23 27 10
We must find any way to get business .	23 4 19 6 1 18 19 1 10

Aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year , and Shannon Airport , the airline 's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union , saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through .	1 11 36 36 0 1 67 35 2 13 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 282 0 0 1 13 0 1 115 24 10

The airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union .	6 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 11 6 0 1 10

What Aeroflot does n't pour into its own gas-guzzling Ilyushins is bartered to the airport authority , which resells it to 11 Western carriers including Air France , Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines .	119 1 4 35 19 38 6 0 0 1 14 22 7 6 0 1 2 33 73 23 7 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 10

That is n't all .	23 11 35 23 10

Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets , but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that ca n't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop .	1 12 0 0 1 12 6 1 136 6 0 1 53 7 0 0 0 1 2 13 1 16 11 0 1 33 4 35 19 23 38 1 38 1 38 0 1 10

Nucor 's plant in Crawfordsville , Ind. , ultimately will produce only one million tons annually , a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket , and it will be years before such plants can compete in the high-profit market .	1 42 1 12 1 2 1 2 16 4 19 36 36 0 1 35 2 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 13 23 4 19 1 30 52 1 4 79 38 6 0 1 10

Moreover , the process is n't without its headaches .	76 2 6 1 48 35 7 6 1 10
Because all operations are connected , one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown .	39 6 1 14 40 2 0 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 10
On some days , the Nucor plant does n't produce anything .	59 6 1 2 6 0 1 4 35 19 23 10
At this point , the minimill capacity wo n't make a great dent in the integrated market , but it does challenge them to develop new markets , says James McCall , vice president , materials , at Battelle , a technology and management-research giant based in Columbus , Ohio .	59 6 1 2 6 0 1 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 13 23 4 134 23 18 19 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 12 1 2 6 1 13 0 1 40 38 1 2 1 10
Indeed , with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity , steelmakers will have to change the way they do business .	76 2 347 1 12 1 105 120 67 500 18 19 1 2 1 4 154 18 19 6 1 23 11 1 10
In the past , says Armco 's chief economist John Corey , steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock .	59 6 1 2 56 1 42 0 0 0 1 2 1 11 6 1 13 11 23 35 38 6 0 1 10
We said : We 've got a product : if you want it , you can buy it , he says , adding : Now we 're figuring out what people need , and are going back to make it .	23 44 106 23 20 21 6 1 104 39 23 11 23 2 23 4 19 23 2 23 27 2 214 106 76 23 37 32 35 119 1 11 2 13 37 120 35 18 19 23 10

When they determined that GM needed parts more quickly , Armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within 15 minutes .	39 23 65 66 1 11 1 67 35 2 1 82 6 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 35 30 1 4 74 40 38 0 1 10
Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival , especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers .	32 52 1 12 0 1 12 0 13 0 1 106 11 6 1 12 1 2 67 30 6 0 1 37 45 7 6 0 1 12 1 13 45 7 0 13 0 1 10
For example , when Detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars , the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled .	59 1 2 39 1 37 45 7 0 1 2 6 0 1 13 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 18 598 0 1 55 23 4 19 1 67 35 57 16 427 55 6 0 1 14 40 10
But steelmakers must also find new markets .	76 1 4 35 19 0 1 10
After letting aluminum-makers take the recycling lead , a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation .	181 278 1 19 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 11 6 0 1 18 5 0 1 7 6 36 0 1 10

Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output , such as coated and electrogalvanized products , which remain beyond the reach of minimills .	1 16 37 113 18 79 57 45 7 0 1 2 69 12 0 13 0 1 2 33 48 7 6 1 12 1 10
Almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines , used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors .	52 6 0 1 40 38 0 1 38 6 0 1 37 32 0 1 2 17 18 5 1 7 52 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 10

Robert Crandall , with the Brookings Institute , agrees .	0 1 2 12 6 0 1 2 34 10
Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar , it 's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills .	39 50 51 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 23 28 266 66 1 12 0 0 1 4 79 500 18 19 6 1 12 1 10
Not to mention the incursion of imports .	1188 185 185 6 1 12 1 10

A 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak , based in Rochester , N.Y. , infringed on patents of Polaroid , of Cambridge , Mass .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 65 66 1 2 40 38 1 2 1 2 48 7 1 12 1 2 12 1 2 1 10
The main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was willful and deliberate .	6 0 1 120 162 319 18 19 1 13 55 6 1 28 24 13 24 10
If so , the damages could be tripled .	109 24 2 6 1 4 74 40 10
Two analysts who have read the transcripts , David Nelson of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Calvert D. Crary , a litigation analyst at Labe , Simpson & Co. , think Judge A.

Mr. Crary said testimony by Kodak 's patent counsel , Francis T. Carr of Kenyon & Kenyon , showed that he worked with Kodak continuously from the outset of the project in an effort to avoid infringement .	0 1 44 1 12 1 42 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 65 66 23 48 7 1 35 38 6 1 12 6 1 38 6 1 18 19 1 10
Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid 's patent positions , and Kodak followed his advice in every instance , Mr. Crary said .	1 82 1 38 0 1 18 19 0 1 70 7 1 42 0 1 2 13 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 2 0 1 27 10
But Irving Kayton , a patent expert at George Mason University School of Law who is familiar with the case , said the fact that seven patents were infringed suggests that infringement was willful .	76 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 12 1 33 28 53 7 6 1 2 44 6 80 66 0 1 14 40 44 6 1 28 24 10
It 's difficult to be that consistently wrong .	192 193 24 18 115 29 29 24 10
Observers also wonder whether Judge Mazzone will use the lost-profits method of determining damages , which Polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award , or the reasonable royalty method .	1 16 162 55 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 93 32 1 2 138 1 11 30 23 4 87 7 6 0 1 2 13 6 0 0 1 10

Moreover , Polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price -- and thus made higher profits -- because it would n't have been forced to match Kodak 's lower prices .	76 2 1 44 23 4 163 139 23 7 6 0 1 106 13 16 21 0 1 106 30 23 4 35 163 151 17 18 19 1 42 0 1 10

International Business Machines Corp. said earnings tumbled 30 % in the third quarter , even a bit further than expected , rendering the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters .	0 0 0 1 44 1 34 67 35 38 6 0 1 2 67 67 67 35 552 40 2 327 6 1 24 38 6 0 0 1 10
The main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives , a business that accounts for some 10 % of IBM 's $ 60 billion of annual revenue .	6 0 1 11 6 1 12 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 6 1 33 48 7 36 0 1 12 1 42 86 0 9 12 0 1 10
IBM , which telegraphed the poor results three weeks ago , also cited an increase in its leasing business , which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term .	1 2 33 11 6 0 1 0 1 26 2 16 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 33 64 18 19 35 1 35 13 19 1 38 6 0 1 10

That compared with the year-earlier $ 1.25 billion , or $ 2.10 a share -- which was inflated by a 15-cents-a-share gain from the sale of some MCI Communications Corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by Fujitsu Ltd. relating to a software dispute .	1 48 7 6 0 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 106 33 14 40 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 13 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 45 7 6 0 1 10

Jay Stevens of Dean Witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $ 9 from $ 9.50 for 1989 and to $ 9.50 from $ 10.35 in 1990 because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected .	0 1 12 0 1 16 11 6 0 0 1 38 86 9 38 86 9 12 1 13 38 86 9 38 86 9 68 1 30 23 44 1 4 115 29 24 47 23 20 60 10
Both estimates would mark declines from the 1988 net of $ 5.81 billion , or $ 9.80 a share , which itself was well below the record IBM set in 1984 .	6 1 4 19 1 12 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 2 33 16 48 161 7 6 1 1 11 38 1 10

He said IBM has priced its leases aggressively , thinking that would help win business .	23 44 1 20 21 6 1 35 2 214 23 4 143 19 1 10
But he said IBM would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer .	76 23 44 1 4 163 139 6 1 35 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 33 4 163 35 139 6 1 7 6 1 10

But the basic technology in the line is almost five years old , which means it is long in the tooth , and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own .	76 6 0 1 12 6 1 28 474 116 29 24 2 90 44 23 28 53 7 6 1 2 13 1 37 32 35 0 1 12 6 1 10

But it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days , and the workstation market , while important , is too small to rely on for much growth .	76 192 193 24 18 5 0 1 161 7 6 0 1 81 1 2 13 6 0 1 2 158 24 2 28 355 24 18 79 35 38 0 1 10

While Monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses , many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses , traders here and in New York said .	39 1 42 0 1 282 0 1 19 1 2 0 0 1 13 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 1 12 0 1 14 22 7 0 1 2 1 78 13 12 0 1 27 10
Options traders were hurt worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options , which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based .	0 1 14 40 35 68 1 38 1 70 7 6 36 0 1 12 1 2 33 16 11 13 11 38 1 62 52 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 1 12 1 12 124 23 14 40 10
Thus , options traders Friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in New York .	76 2 0 1 16 14 22 7 1 33 16 28 0 1 3 84 23 40 38 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
Jeffrey Miller of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market , it is very easy for these guys to get wiped out .	0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 65 66 59 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 2 192 197 29 24 198 6 1 18 74 40 35 10
That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures .	23 4 35 19 6 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 10
Options traders who , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on Friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling .	0 1 33 2 85 1 12 6 0 1 2 13 1 2 20 35 21 0 1 38 1 13 0 1 14 17 38 1 18 5 6 1 35 7 6 36 0 1 2 33 48 161 7 23 12 6 1 30 23 37 120 10
They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss .	23 16 11 6 1 38 0 1 35 18 5 6 1 7 0 1 106 97 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange , which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday , when investors fled the market because of huge losses .	6 0 1 12 1 28 43 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 33 20 35 16 169 7 6 1 12 0 1 2 75 1 11 6 1 70 7 0 1 10
Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's halt in stock-index futures .	327 1 24 438 6 80 66 137 137 76 6 1 11 0 0 1 38 1 12 6 0 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 10
But while the Merc reopened a half hour later , the CBOE remained closed , leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses .	76 39 6 1 34 6 0 1 26 2 6 1 28 24 2 327 0 0 1 43 18 19 1 33 4 163 21 6 1 10
CBOE Chairman Alger Duke Chapman , said that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade .	0 0 0 0 1 2 65 66 2 59 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 64 18 79 38 6 1 33 82 6 0 0 1 18 79 10
Exchange officials reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon , and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time , the CBOE reasoned that its best course was to remain closed .	0 1 65 66 23 4 35 163 164 43 18 19 52 6 1 38 6 1 120 67 35 2 13 352 6 0 1 7 6 1 93 120 38 6 0 13 0 1 2 6 1 65 66 6 0 1 64 18 115 24 10
The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses .	6 1 28 29 24 38 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 78 2 30 23 14 17 18 5 6 1 7 0 1 12 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 38 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday 's rout .	1 72 16 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 18 74 17 18 74 40 35 38 6 1 38 6 1 12 1 42 1 10
Fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after Friday 's close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried about another potential market plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange officials said .	1 16 11 36 0 1 12 1 40 38 1 42 1 12 1 2 69 69 774 66 1 2 22 7 6 0 0 1 35 2 4 344 23 79 38 1 2 0 0 1 27 10
Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the CBOE , the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. , as well as the firm 's owner , Stephen Fossett , put up a total of $ 50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday .	76 2 59 6 0 1 32 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 2 6 0 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 2 102 102 13 6 1 42 1 2 0 1 2 11 35 6 1 12 86 0 9 18 19 6 0 1 182 22 7 6 0 0 0 1 335 1 6 1 34 35 35 10
S. Waite Rawls III , vice chairman of Continental Bank , First Options ' parent company , said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by Fossett , almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders .	0 0 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 2 44 6 1 11 35 36 0 1 16 40 38 1 2 0 1 12 23 45 7 0 0 1 10
Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money , Mr. Rawls said .	1 13 6 1 48 35 7 6 1 12 1 2 0 1 27 10
A package of credit support was put together -- including the assets of Steve and his firm .	6 1 12 0 1 14 40 35 67 38 6 1 12 1 13 6 1 10
The bailout was cobbled together over the weekend , with officials from the Federal Reserve Board , Securities and Exchange Commission , Comptroller of the Currency and Treasury as well as the options exchanges .	6 1 14 40 35 38 6 1 2 38 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 0 13 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 13 1 102 102 13 6 0 1 10
It was great to have the luxury of time , Mr. Rawls said .	192 193 24 18 19 6 1 12 1 2 0 1 27 10
At one point , an options industry official had to talk the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 's night watchman into giving him the home phone number of Silas Keene , Chicago Fed president .	59 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 64 18 5 6 0 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 155 146 23 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 0 0 1 10
First Options did n't have to put any money into the bailout .	0 1 4 35 154 18 5 6 1 7 6 1 10
Yesterday 's rally in the stock , futures and options markets led CBOE and Amex officials to conclude that the $ 50 million in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by First Options .	1 42 1 12 6 0 2 1 13 0 1 82 0 13 0 1 18 77 66 6 86 0 9 12 1 72 16 4 35 154 18 74 40 38 0 1 10
The Fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October 1987 crash as well , Mr. Rawls said .	6 0 1 11 6 1 13 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 67 35 2 0 1 27 10
A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the Fossett bailout , but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies .	6 0 1 65 66 0 1 48 7 0 13 0 1 38 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 2 13 66 1 14 35 40 38 6 1 10
It was their business decision , the official said .	23 11 6 0 1 2 6 1 27 10
Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets .	1 12 0 0 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 38 0 1 2 65 66 6 125 0 9 1 28 24 2 13 28 24 18 143 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , said Paul Stevens , OCC president and chief operating officer .	23 11 6 0 1 33 11 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 0 1 10
Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant .	0 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 125 0 9 1 12 6 1 10
But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options Clearing Corp. contributed $ 20 million to the guarantee , the CBOE put up $ 8 million , the Amex added $ 4 million and $ 18 million came from Mr. Fossett 's own assets .	76 0 13 0 1 65 66 0 0 1 73 86 0 9 7 6 1 2 6 1 11 35 86 0 9 2 6 1 11 86 0 9 13 86 0 9 48 7 0 1 42 0 1 10
Mr. Fossett could n't be reached to comment .	0 1 4 35 74 40 18 79 10
Debora Foster takes off her necklace , settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward .	0 1 11 35 6 1 2 11 23 38 6 0 1 13 16 34 35 10
With a jazz-piano tape playing softly in the background , the soothing hands of Sabina Vidunas begin to work on Ms. Foster 's neck and shoulders .	347 6 0 1 120 35 38 6 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 64 18 87 7 0 1 42 1 13 1 10
It 's like an oasis in this room , Ms. Foster purrs .	23 48 7 6 1 38 6 1 2 0 1 27 10
The room in question is the directors ' lounge of H.J. Heinz Co. , 60 floors above the bustle of Pittsburgh .	6 1 12 1 11 6 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 2 0 1 142 6 1 12 1 10
There , amid oil paintings and marble tables , massages are administered every Wednesday .	76 2 59 0 1 13 0 1 2 1 14 40 81 1 10
On days that I 'm really busy , says Ms. Foster , who works in public relations for the company , it seems decadent to take time off for a massage .	59 1 75 23 28 29 24 2 56 0 1 2 33 34 38 0 1 38 6 1 2 192 193 24 18 19 1 35 38 6 1 10
Although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks , on-site massage , as it is known in the trade , is certainly infiltrating corporate America .	39 52 1 4 35 19 0 1 2 0 1 2 75 23 14 40 38 6 1 2 37 16 32 0 1 10
In some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office , fearful that upper-level executives wo n't approve .	59 6 1 0 1 11 0 1 38 6 1 2 266 66 0 1 4 35 79 10
Ms. Foster 's indulgence is nothing like the oily , hour-long rubfests enjoyed by spa visitors .	0 1 42 1 11 23 12 6 0 2 0 1 40 38 0 1 10
Nor does it at all resemble -LRB- despite what some executives think -RRB- the more intimate variety offered at specialty parlors in bad parts of town .	76 515 23 85 23 19 166 38 119 6 1 11 167 6 36 0 1 40 38 0 1 38 0 1 12 1 10
On the contrary , office rubdowns usually take place in dimly lighted conference rooms , where stressed-out employees relax in specially designed chairs , fully clothed .	59 6 1 2 0 1 16 11 1 38 36 0 0 1 2 75 0 1 34 38 36 0 1 2 29 24 10
The massages last 15 minutes and typically cost about $ 10 .	6 1 34 67 35 13 16 11 0 86 9 10
Some companies , including Heinz , even pay part of the fee .	6 1 2 12 1 2 16 11 1 12 6 1 10
Ms. Vidunas has been seeing some 15 clients a visit since the program was started at Heinz last year .	0 1 20 121 32 36 0 1 92 1 30 6 1 14 40 38 1 67 35 10
Anthony J.F. O'Reilly , the company 's chairman , swears by her firm touch , saying regular massages are a balm for his old football injuries .	0 0 1 2 6 1 42 1 2 48 7 6 0 1 2 214 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Massage advocates say that kneading the head , shoulders , neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale .	0 1 65 66 32 6 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 4 79 6 0 1 310 32 1 13 32 1 10
They also insist that touching is a basic need , as powerful as the need for food or sleep , and that the office is as good a place as any to do it .	23 16 65 66 1 11 6 0 1 2 29 24 84 6 1 12 1 13 1 2 13 66 6 1 11 62 52 6 1 12 23 18 19 23 10
The blood flows to your head , you feel lightheaded and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck , says Minnie Morey , an operations supervisor at the Social Security office in Grand Rapids , Mich. , where massages began last month .	6 1 34 38 6 1 2 23 28 24 13 23 4 35 19 1 12 6 1 13 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 1 2 75 1 34 67 35 10
When you leave the room after your massage , people say you look like you 're glowing .	39 23 11 6 1 38 6 1 2 1 44 23 48 273 23 37 120 10
Adds Candice Ohlman , the 35-year-old masseuse who plies her trade in the Grand Rapids office , They fall in love with my hands .	271 0 1 2 6 0 1 33 11 6 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 23 260 7 1 7 6 1 10
Not everyone , however , is at ease with office massage .	52 23 2 16 2 48 7 1 12 0 1 10
Three years ago , the Internal Revenue Service 's office in San Jose , Calif. , opened its doors to on-site massage .	0 1 234 2 6 0 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 2 1 2 73 6 1 7 0 1 10
And even though employees paid the bill , taxpayers grumbled .	76 137 39 1 11 6 1 2 1 34 10
Sometimes , with the release of stress , you hear oohs ' and ahs ' coming out of the room , explains Morgan Banks , the agency 's health specialist .	76 2 59 6 1 12 1 2 23 235 1 106 1 123 106 45 161 7 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 1 10
And you ca n't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing oohs ' and ahs .	76 23 4 35 276 1 120 38 6 1 32 1 106 13 1 10
Last month , the complaints intensified and the massages ended .	137 76 2 6 1 34 13 6 1 34 10
Now we 're looking for a room with thicker walls , Ms. Banks says .	76 23 37 45 7 6 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
Massage also has an image problem to contend with .	1 16 11 6 0 1 18 87 7 10
Some masseurs have tried to get around this by calling themselves bodyworkers and describing their office visits as reinvigoration breaks .	6 1 20 94 18 87 7 23 57 146 23 1 13 111 6 0 1 7 0 1 10
But massage , no matter how chaste , is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution , and that makes some executives nervous .	76 1 2 92 1 1124 24 2 14 35 22 38 0 1 7 0 1 12 1 2 13 23 136 6 1 24 10
Last year , the research and development division of Weyerhaeuser Co. , the large wood-products concern , invited a masseuse to its Tacoma , Wash. , offices .	137 76 2 6 1 13 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 73 6 1 7 6 36 2 0 2 1 10
Phil Harms , a software engineer , was an eager customer .	0 1 2 6 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 10
You build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day , he says .	23 11 35 6 1 12 1 120 38 6 1 81 1 2 23 27 10
But after about eight months , the vice president of the division , Ed Soule , learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt .	76 59 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 2 48 7 6 1 13 73 23 7 6 1 10
Mr. Soule says his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room ; the department 's supervised health facility would have been fine .	0 1 44 6 0 1 65 66 6 1 37 182 40 38 6 0 0 1 91 6 1 42 0 0 1 4 163 164 24 10
In my view , -LCB- massages -RCB- should be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around , he says .	59 6 1 2 166 1 167 4 74 40 38 6 0 1 12 1 13 1 78 2 23 27 10
Given such attitudes , some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly .	59 52 1 2 6 0 1 64 18 87 7 6 1 35 10
Russell Borner of Park Ridge , N.J. , says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in New York -- unbeknownst to the company 's executives .	0 1 12 0 1 2 1 2 44 23 20 121 120 38 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 13 0 1 12 0 1 140 53 7 6 1 42 1 10
He visits the same department every two or three weeks .	23 11 6 0 1 96 67 13 67 35 10
His massage chair is kept in a closet , and a secretary escorts him past security .	6 0 1 14 40 38 6 1 2 13 6 1 11 23 38 1 10
This is common with a lot of large companies , says Mr. Borner , who worked for American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for 23 years before choosing his current trade .	23 28 53 7 6 1 12 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 33 48 7 0 0 0 0 1 38 0 1 57 32 6 0 1 10
Managers , he contends , are afraid how they 're going to look in the eyes of their peers .	1 2 23 44 2 28 554 55 23 37 113 18 79 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
My vision is to change human consciousness towards touch .	6 1 64 18 19 0 1 12 1 10
My attitude is : Let 's come out of the closet .	6 1 4 106 344 23 87 161 7 6 1 10
Occasionally , all that 's needed is a little coaxing .	76 2 23 33 14 40 11 6 0 1 10
Elisa Byler , a St. Louis masseuse , won over officials at Emerson Electric Co. , a maker of electrical and electronic equipment , by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage .	0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 11 35 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 13 0 1 2 57 32 1 13 0 1 32 6 0 1 12 1 10
She notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits .	23 65 66 23 16 11 1 38 6 0 1 10
I pull my hair back , wear a little makeup and look corporate , says Ms. Byler , who has been visiting Emerson since January .	23 11 6 1 35 2 11 6 0 1 13 28 24 2 56 0 1 2 33 20 121 32 1 38 1 10
If I go in there as I normally dress , they 'd ask , Who is this hippie ?	39 23 34 38 1 30 23 16 34 2 23 4 286 2 246 11 6 1 10
The self-proclaimed father of on-site massage is David Palmer , a 41-year-old San Francisco masseur whose mission is to save the touch-starved masses .	6 0 1 12 0 1 11 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 135 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 10
To help do this , Mr. Palmer developed a portable massage chair three years ago that he hopes will bring structured touching into mainstream America .	18 143 19 23 2 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 0 1 26 471 23 232 4 19 0 1 38 0 1 10

Mr. Palmer , who serves as president of the On-Site Massage Association and writes an industry newsletter , says some 4,000 practitioners -- out of about 50,000 certified masseurs across the country -- now use massage chairs in the workplace , as well as on street corners , in airports and malls , and at conventions and other gatherings where weary people can be found .	0 1 2 33 48 7 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 11 6 0 1 2 44 36 0 1 106 230 7 36 0 0 1 12 6 1 106 16 11 0 1 38 6 1 2 102 102 13 38 0 1 2 38 1 13 1 2 13 38 1 13 0 1 75 0 1 4 74 40 10
Scot MacInnis , a masseur in Boulder , Colo. , had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural-foods supermarket as part of a store promotion .	0 1 2 6 1 12 1 2 1 2 11 6 0 1 57 32 6 1 38 6 0 1 38 1 12 6 0 1 10

In what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to China since the June 4 killings in Beijing , an international bank syndicate has terminated a $ 55 million credit for a Shanghai property project .	59 118 14 17 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 38 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 6 0 0 1 20 21 6 125 0 9 1 12 6 0 0 1 10

But several weeks ago , in the wake of the Beijing killings , the loan was canceled , according to bankers and executives close to the project .	76 0 1 234 2 59 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 14 40 2 70 7 1 13 1 24 84 6 1 10
Asia Development and Schroders declined to comment on the move .	0 1 13 1 64 18 87 7 6 1 10
Lenders had doubts about the project even before June 4 , but the harsh crackdown , which caused many businesses to reassess their China transactions , gave the banks the out they wanted , says an official close to the Shanghai venture .	1 11 1 12 6 1 67 38 86 9 2 13 6 0 1 2 33 82 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 2 108 6 1 6 1 23 11 2 56 6 1 24 84 6 0 1 10

Many bankers view property-sector loans as particularly risky .	0 1 73 0 1 46 29 24 10

The company owes $ 11 million to the Shui On Group , the project 's Hong Kong contractor , and a significant , though unspecified , amount in legal fees to Coudert Brothers , a U.S. law firm , the sources say .	6 1 73 86 0 9 7 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 13 6 36 2 36 0 2 1 12 0 1 7 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 27 10
The project , known as Lotus Mansion , has been mired in controversy .	6 1 2 22 7 0 1 2 20 151 40 38 1 10
When the loan agreement was announced , it was hailed as one of the first Western-style financing transactions ever used in China .	39 6 0 1 14 40 2 23 14 22 7 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 16 40 38 1 10
Unlike most loans to China , there was no Chinese guarantor .	59 0 1 12 1 2 50 51 6 0 1 10
Instead , the banks secured a promise from state-owned Bank of Communications that it would lend Asia Development the entire $ 55 million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing .	76 2 6 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 12 1 75 23 4 221 0 1 6 0 86 0 9 38 1 18 19 1 12 6 0 1 10
The loan was to have matured in just two to three years , as soon as construction was completed .	6 1 64 18 163 60 38 36 0 228 0 1 2 67 35 117 1 14 40 10
But in a letter sent in August to Asia Development , Schroders said the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan-management committee on time , according to officials close to the project .	76 59 6 1 22 38 1 7 0 1 2 1 44 6 1 14 40 30 6 1 20 94 18 19 0 0 1 13 5 0 1 7 6 0 1 38 1 2 70 7 1 24 84 6 1 10
Creditors involved in the project contend , however , that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations .	1 24 84 6 1 65 2 35 2 66 6 1 16 11 23 18 87 7 6 0 1 10
Instead , the creditors say , the loan fell victim to nervousness about China 's political turmoil , as well as to concern about the loan 's security .	76 2 6 1 44 2 6 1 73 1 7 1 12 1 42 0 1 2 102 102 13 7 1 12 6 1 42 1 10

The proposed merger comes as K mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as Wal-Mart Stores Inc .	6 0 1 34 30 0 1 42 1 37 120 13 1 12 6 0 0 1 37 120 67 35 815 7 52 1 12 0 0 1 10

In the year ended Jan. 31 , Pace rang up profit of $ 9.4 million , or 72 cents a share , after a tax-loss carry-forward , on sales of $ 1.3 billion , and analysts expect its results to continue to improve .	59 6 1 40 8 9 2 1 11 35 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 92 1 2 12 6 0 1 2 12 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 1 82 6 1 18 154 18 79 10
The company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability , said Margo McGlade of PaineWebber Inc. , who had been forecasting a 46 % jump in Pace 's net income from operations this year and another 42 % increase next year .	6 1 11 6 1 67 35 38 1 2 56 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 20 121 32 6 36 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 12 1 92 1 13 6 36 0 1 69 78 10
Warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off .	0 1 37 16 113 18 79 35 10
But some analysts contend K mart has agreed to pay too much for Pace .	76 6 1 44 0 1 20 94 18 5 0 1 7 1 10
Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation , it 's expensive , said Wayne Hood of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .	137 39 23 260 7 23 7 6 0 1 2 23 28 24 2 56 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
In my opinion , you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry .	59 6 1 2 23 4 35 19 6 1 12 1 30 23 37 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Ms. McGlade of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal .	0 1 12 1 11 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
If K mart ca n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets ?	39 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 35 38 1 2 243 549 23 32 1 45 7 0 0 1 10
She said , I would say K mart 's number one job is to address its market-share loss -LCB- in discount stores -RCB- , which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins .	23 44 2 23 4 215 0 1 42 0 0 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 166 12 0 1 167 2 90 16 4 87 7 0 0 1 10
At that point , perhaps diversification would be appropriate .	59 6 1 2 76 1 4 115 24 10

The Quotrons were wrong .	6 1 28 24 10

At about 10:40 a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm , a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked , What 's going on ?	59 0 1 123 59 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 33 11 13 11 23 12 6 36 0 1 48 7 6 0 1 13 586 2 246 37 120 35 10

To confuse matters further , when UAL Corp. stock finally opened on the New York Stock Exchange at 11:08 a.m. , the price was listed at $ 324.75 a share , up about $ 45 from Friday ; in fact , its true price was $ 224.75 , down $ 55 .	18 19 1 35 2 165 0 0 1 16 60 38 6 0 0 0 1 38 1 123 2 6 1 14 22 7 86 9 92 1 2 38 0 86 9 68 1 91 59 1 2 6 0 1 11 86 9 2 38 86 9 10

Dillon Read 's Ms. Stark said in early afternoon that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification , and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen .	0 1 42 0 1 65 38 0 1 66 23 37 35 111 1 13 0 1 46 53 7 1 2 13 23 44 0 1 64 18 19 6 1 23 11 38 6 1 10
It was the second time in less than a week that Quotron has had problems calculating the industrial average .	23 11 6 0 1 140 24 84 6 1 30 1 20 21 1 32 6 0 1 10
At the start of trading last Wednesday , the average appeared to plunge more than 200 points .	59 6 1 12 1 69 78 2 6 1 64 18 79 24 304 67 35 10
Actually , it was down only a few points at the time .	76 2 23 28 126 52 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Quotron said that snafu , which lasted nine minutes , resulted from a failure to adjust for a 4-for-1 stock split at Philip Morris Cos .	1 44 6 1 2 33 34 67 35 2 48 7 6 1 18 87 7 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
A Quotron spokeswoman said recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday 's problems .	6 0 1 44 0 0 1 4 163 169 7 1 42 1 10
She said Quotron switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected .	23 44 1 48 7 6 0 1 30 6 1 14 40 10
Today of all days , she lamented .	1 12 6 1 2 23 476 10

Steven F. Kaplan was named a senior vice president of this graphics equipment company .	0 0 1 14 15 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
He retains his current positions as chief strategic officer of AM International and president of AM Ventures .	23 11 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 12 0 1 10
Houston attorney Dale Friend , representing a plaintiff in a damage suit , says he has negotiated a settlement that will strike a blow for his client .	0 0 0 1 2 32 6 1 38 6 0 1 2 44 23 20 21 6 1 33 4 19 6 1 38 6 1 10
Literally .	24 10
It turns out Mr. Friend 's client , Machelle Parks of Cincinnati , did n't like the way defense attorney Tom Alexander acted during the legal proceedings .	23 44 35 0 1 42 1 2 0 1 12 1 2 4 35 19 6 1 0 0 0 1 34 38 6 0 1 10
So she has agreed to forgo monetary damages against Mr. Alexander 's client in return for the right to punch the attorney .	76 23 20 94 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 42 1 38 1 12 6 1 18 19 6 1 10
Ms. Parks 's mother also gets to cuff Mr. Alexander .	0 1 42 1 16 64 18 19 0 1 10
So does Mr. Friend and his law partner , Nick Nichols .	205 206 0 1 13 6 0 1 2 0 1 10
The bizarre arrangement grows out of Mr. Alexander 's representation of Derr Construction Co. , one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Ms. Parks , the widow of a construction worker killed in January 1987 while working on a new Houston convention center .	6 0 1 48 161 7 0 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 40 38 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 40 38 1 123 57 45 7 6 0 0 0 1 10
Last month , Mr. Friend says , Mr. Alexander 's associate agreed that Derr would pay $ 50,000 as part of an overall settlement .	137 76 2 0 1 44 2 0 1 42 1 65 66 1 4 19 86 9 38 1 12 6 0 1 10
But Mr. Alexander scuttled the deal at the last minute , angering the plaintiff 's side .	76 0 1 11 6 1 38 6 0 1 2 32 6 1 42 1 10
I never agreed to it , Mr. Alexander says , adding that it 's not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements .	23 16 48 7 23 2 0 1 27 2 207 66 192 193 35 24 18 19 6 0 1 10
When Ms. Parks and her mother heard about what had happened , Mr. Friend says , they volunteered that they would like to give Mr. Alexander a good walloping .	39 0 1 13 6 1 48 7 118 20 60 2 0 1 44 2 23 65 66 23 4 154 18 221 0 1 6 0 1 10
Mr. Friend says he passed that along to his adversary , and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which Derr could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at Mr. Alexander .	0 1 44 23 11 23 35 38 6 1 2 13 76 23 37 45 7 6 0 1 12 124 1 4 19 6 1 13 6 1 4 19 6 1 12 0 1 10
Although time and place have yet to be determined , some details are in place .	39 1 13 1 64 35 18 74 40 2 6 1 48 7 1 10
Mr. Friend says he agreed to strike Mr. Alexander above the belt .	0 1 44 23 64 18 19 0 1 38 6 1 10
Ms. Parks and her mother indicated they want to catch him unawares from behind , he says .	0 1 13 6 1 44 23 64 18 19 23 78 38 1 2 23 27 10
Mr. Alexander , for his part , insisted that the punchers ca n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else , ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start .	0 1 2 85 6 1 2 65 66 6 1 4 35 5 6 0 1 7 23 78 2 4 35 19 6 0 1 13 4 35 19 6 0 1 10
Mr. Alexander says he regards the agreement , which has n't been submitted to a judge , as something of a joke .	0 1 44 23 73 6 1 2 33 20 35 151 22 7 6 1 2 7 23 12 6 1 10
However , he acknowledges they have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to .	76 2 23 44 23 11 6 1 93 32 6 1 12 23 30 23 16 64 236 10
Mr. Friend says his side is dead serious .	0 1 44 6 1 28 29 24 10
Although they do n't contemplate delivering any disabling blows , he says that Mr. Alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability , just in case .	39 23 4 35 168 32 6 0 1 2 23 65 66 0 1 4 74 17 18 19 6 1 12 1 2 70 7 1 10
After two years of drought , it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday .	59 0 1 12 1 2 23 11 1 38 6 0 0 1 35 10
As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987 .	39 0 1 34 2 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 42 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 34 2 32 0 1 38 6 0 1 12 1 78 10
The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said .	6 0 1 12 1 82 0 1 18 19 0 1 38 6 1 12 1 30 1 34 2 1 27 10
Guys were minting money in there today , said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago .	1 37 32 1 38 1 35 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 10
The S&P 500 futures contract , which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions , jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of the day .	6 0 0 0 1 2 33 34 38 1 12 6 0 1 38 0 1 2 34 67 835 67 35 38 1 67 35 38 6 0 1 2 16 34 67 35 81 1 68 6 1 10
Each index point represents a $ 500 profit for each S&P 500 contract held .	6 0 1 11 6 125 9 1 12 6 0 0 1 40 10
For the first time since the 1987 crash , traders said that they were able to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market .	59 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 1 65 66 23 28 43 18 19 0 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 38 6 36 0 1 10
Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago .	0 1 13 0 1 20 60 70 7 0 1 2 111 23 155 32 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 0 1 107 10
Since the crash , many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the S&P 500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them .	59 6 1 2 0 0 1 20 35 21 0 1 38 80 66 6 0 0 1 2 85 1 12 6 0 0 1 120 2 4 115 24 30 1 48 7 23 10
More than 400 traders jammed the S&P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell .	24 25 0 1 11 6 0 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am	1 37 32 1 13 1 81 0 0 1 68 6 1 12 1 12 1 123
The contract fell five points at the open to 323.85 , the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the Merc to stem a market slide .	6 1 34 67 35 38 6 1 38 1 2 6 0 0 1 40 38 1 40 38 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply higher .	76 0 1 16 28 24 13 48 7 1 2 32 1 67 35 10
The market hovered near Friday 's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour , moving several index points higher or lower in seconds , then broke higher and did n't look back .	6 1 368 38 1 42 0 1 12 1 38 52 6 0 1 2 120 0 0 1 26 13 26 38 1 2 16 34 35 13 4 35 115 24 10
The S&P 500 contract that expires in December closed up a record 15.65 points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts .	6 0 0 1 33 34 38 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 38 1 12 36 0 1 10
Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart , said one S&P 500 broker .	1 1361 230 7 6 1 37 32 1 13 1 33 11 6 0 1 123 2 56 0 0 0 1 10
You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune , he marveled .	23 4 87 7 6 1 13 87 7 6 1 13 19 6 1 2 23 27 10
Several of Wall Street 's largest securities firms , including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc. , were also large buyers , traders said .	1 12 0 1 42 0 0 1 2 12 0 0 1 13 0 1 2 11 35 0 1 2 1 27 10
Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week , traders said .	0 1 48 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 67 35 2 1 27 10
Brokerage firms as a rule do n't comment on their market activity .	0 1 85 6 1 4 35 87 7 6 0 1 10
Unlike the week following Black Monday two years ago , individual traders in the S&P 500 pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their one-day profits .	59 6 1 32 0 1 0 1 107 2 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 37 35 156 29 53 7 6 0 1 10
With the FBI around here , bragging rights are a thing of the past , said one trader , referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in 46 indictments lodged against individuals on the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade .	59 6 1 158 24 2 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 120 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 33 72 16 20 169 7 0 1 22 7 1 12 6 1 13 6 0 1 12 1 10
The market for $ 200 billion of high-yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from Friday 's plunge .	6 1 12 86 0 9 12 0 0 1 11 23 12 6 1 30 6 0 0 0 1 48 7 1 42 1 10
But the junk recovery , led by the bellwether RJR Holdings bonds , was precarious .	76 6 0 1 2 40 38 6 0 0 0 1 2 28 24 10
No trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds , securities industry officials said .	6 1 34 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 0 0 1 27 10
On Friday , trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues .	59 1 2 1 12 52 6 1 48 7 6 1 30 0 1 34 13 0 1 28 43 18 19 0 13 0 1 12 0 1 10
Nothing traded on Friday , and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened yesterday , said Raymond Minella , co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co .	23 34 38 1 2 13 1 28 35 29 554 55 6 1 4 163 60 35 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
But we had a fairly active day yesterday .	76 23 11 6 36 0 1 35 10
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , the leading underwriter of junk bonds , I was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight , said David Feinman , a junk bond trader .	59 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 23 28 43 18 87 7 6 36 0 1 35 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 10
Now , I feel maybe there 's a little bit of euphoria .	76 2 23 44 76 50 51 6 0 1 12 1 10
But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday , he said , You could n't buy -LCB- junk bonds -RCB- and you could n't give them away .	76 39 6 0 1 48 7 6 0 0 1 35 2 23 44 2 23 4 35 19 166 0 1 167 13 23 4 35 19 23 35 10
Yesterday 's rally was led by RJR Holdings 13 3\/4 % bonds , which initially tumbled three points , or $ 30 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 96 1\/4 before rebounding to 99 3\/4 .	1 42 1 14 40 38 0 0 88 36 0 1 2 33 16 34 67 35 2 13 8 9 68 6 125 9 0 1 2 38 0 1 57 120 38 0 1 10
Bonds issued by Kroger , Duracell , Safeway and American Standard also showed big gains , recovering almost all their losses from Friday and early yesterday .	1 40 38 1 2 1 2 1 13 0 1 16 11 0 1 2 32 52 6 0 1 12 1 13 0 1 10
But traders said the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group , in which trades can be executed easily , and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability to trade without too much difficulty -- has steadily deteriorated this year .	76 1 44 6 0 0 1 16 37 45 7 6 0 1 2 12 124 1 4 74 40 35 2 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 124 1 106 13 6 1 18 79 38 0 0 1 106 20 16 60 81 1 10
Liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market , said Mr. Minella of Merrill .	1 20 35 169 7 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 2 56 0 1 12 1 10
The deadbeats are still deadbeats , said Mr. Feinman of Drexel .	6 1 11 35 1 2 56 0 1 12 1 10
Analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for investors .	1 28 266 66 1 12 6 0 1 4 115 24 38 1 10
Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management , citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later , says , We 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986 .	0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 1 217 1 42 0 1 217 1 2 32 6 1 12 0 0 1 33 28 24 38 6 0 1 12 1 13 34 35 2 44 2 23 48 35 7 6 1 75 23 37 113 18 19 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 12 1 10
Mark Bachmann , a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corp. , confirms that there is increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market .	0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 42 1 2 65 66 50 51 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Junk bonds are a highly stratified market , said Lewis Glucksman , vice chairman of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .	0 1 11 6 36 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 10
There 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good .	50 51 6 0 1 12 1 33 28 29 24 13 6 0 1 12 1 33 28 35 29 24 10
Analysts at Standard & Poor 's say junk bond offerings by tightly stretched issuers seem to be growing .	1 12 0 0 0 1 44 0 0 1 12 36 0 1 64 18 168 120 10
Almost $ 8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from SCI TV , Gillette Holdings -LRB- not related to Gillette Co. -RRB- , Interco , Seaman Furniture , Allied Stores , Federated Department Stores , National Gypsum , M.D.C. Holdings , Micropolis , Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications .	0 86 0 9 12 0 1 33 14 152 24 11 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 158 29 53 7 0 1 167 2 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 10
You could still have some very bad times ahead , said Mr. Bachmann .	23 4 35 19 6 36 0 1 35 2 56 0 1 10
It 's possible to have a 10 % default rate in one year , because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy .	192 193 24 18 19 6 36 0 0 1 38 0 1 2 30 23 37 35 32 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 36 0 1 10
I 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom .	23 28 35 35 189 214 23 20 21 6 1 10
But yesterday 's rally among good junk was a badly needed tonic for the market .	76 1 42 1 12 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
Many issues bounced off the floor , Mr. Minella said , and benchmark junk issues recovered all of their losses from Friday and early yesterday .	0 1 48 7 6 1 2 0 1 44 2 13 0 0 1 11 23 12 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 10
In contrast , he says , The stock market gained back only about half what it lost Friday , and the -LCB- government -RCB- bond market lost about half what it gained Friday .	59 1 2 23 44 2 6 0 1 11 35 36 0 1 138 23 11 35 2 13 0 166 0 167 0 1 11 0 1 138 23 11 35 10
Traders said yesterday 's rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month .	1 44 1 42 1 14 40 38 0 1 45 7 1 38 6 0 1 12 1 92 0 1 10
In addition , mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected .	59 1 2 0 1 4 35 154 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 223 220 40 10
Sometimes a shakeout is healthy , said Drexel 's Mr. Feinman .	76 6 1 28 24 2 56 1 42 0 1 10
People will learn to be more circumspect .	1 4 154 18 115 29 24 10
If they do good credit analysis , they will avoid the hand grenades .	39 23 11 0 0 1 2 23 4 19 6 0 1 10
I think the market is in good shape .	23 44 6 1 48 7 0 1 10
Should you really own stocks ?	244 23 185 19 1 10
That 's a question a lot of people are asking , following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility .	23 11 6 1 6 1 12 1 37 32 2 38 6 0 1 42 0 1 12 1 10
Whipsawed financially and emotionally by Friday 's heartstopping 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and yesterday 's 88-point rebound , they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market .	40 35 13 35 38 1 42 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 13 1 42 0 1 2 23 37 427 55 6 1 11 6 1 45 7 6 1 10
The answer , say academic researchers , money managers and investment specialists , is yes -- as long as you approach the stock market as an investor .	6 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 2 11 1 140 24 945 346 23 11 6 0 1 38 6 1 10
But , they say , people should n't try to be traders , who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock .	76 2 23 44 2 1 4 35 154 18 19 1 2 33 34 13 34 38 6 1 18 19 6 0 0 1 13 19 6 0 0 1 10
The case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling .	6 1 93 32 1 38 6 1 28 24 10
If you look at 75 years worth of investment history -- including the Great Depression and every bear market since -- stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot , says Barry Berlin , vice president at First Wachovia Capital Management .	39 23 48 46 116 29 53 7 0 1 106 84 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 78 106 1 20 21 52 23 6 1 4 163 21 38 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
A dollar invested in the stock market in 1926 would have grown to $ 473.29 by the end of last June , according to Laurence Siegel , managing director at Ibbotson Associates Inc .	6 1 22 7 6 0 1 38 1 4 163 60 38 86 9 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 70 7 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
But a dollar invested in long-term bonds in 1926 would have grown to only $ 16.56 , and a dollar put in Treasury bills would equal a meager $ 9.29 .	76 6 1 22 7 0 1 38 1 4 163 60 38 0 86 9 2 13 6 1 22 7 0 1 4 19 6 0 86 9 10
The longer the time period , the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market .	1362 24 905 0 1 2 759 24 1 50 51 93 32 1 38 6 0 1 10
Over time , the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio .	59 1 2 6 1 16 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
For instance , Ken Gregory , a San Francisco money manager , calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , the chance of losing money is 3 % to 4 % over a 10-year period , compared with 15 % over three years and 30 % over one year .	59 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 2 65 66 39 6 1 11 6 1 12 1 33 11 6 0 0 1 42 0 1 2 6 1 93 32 1 11 0 1 132 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 70 7 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 12 0 1 10
If you do n't need the money for 10 years , there 's a clear-cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks , Mr. Gregory says .	39 23 4 35 19 6 1 38 0 1 2 50 51 6 0 1 93 45 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 27 10
Stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns , says John Blankenship Jr. , president of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners .	0 1 16 4 19 6 0 1 6 1 11 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
Stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says .	1 11 6 1 12 6 1 42 1 70 7 0 1 2 1 2 0 1 13 1 2 23 27 10
There are some important caveats : Before investing in stocks , individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank , most investment advisers say .	50 51 6 0 1 104 181 45 7 1 2 1 4 19 305 148 0 228 0 1 12 0 1 152 24 38 6 1 2 0 0 1 27 10
Individuals also should focus on building equity in a home , which provides some protection against inflation , as well as a nest-egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living .	1 16 4 87 155 32 1 12 6 1 2 33 11 6 1 12 1 2 102 102 13 6 1 33 4 74 40 35 70 7 1 18 143 19 6 1 12 0 1 10
People also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future -- for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses .	1 16 4 35 5 1 7 1 471 23 4 5 38 6 0 1 67 38 1 2 7 0 0 1 13 0 1 10
You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge , says Mr. Blankenship , a Del Mar , Calif. financial planner .	23 4 154 18 19 6 1 38 6 1 75 6 1 11 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 36 36 2 0 0 1 10
But once the basics are covered , then I would start to invest , even if it 's as little as $ 1,000 , says Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc .	76 39 6 1 14 40 2 76 23 4 154 18 79 2 67 30 23 11 0 1 12 86 9 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
He says individuals should consider not just stocks , but other long-term investments , such as high-quality bonds .	23 44 1 4 19 52 0 1 2 13 0 0 1 2 69 12 0 1 10
Despite the strong case for stocks , however , most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments .	59 6 0 1 12 1 2 76 2 0 1 65 66 1 4 35 154 18 87 7 0 1 10
It 's very difficult to do , says Donald Holt , a market strategist for Wedbush Morgan Securities , a Los Angeles brokerage firm .	23 28 29 127 18 19 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 10
Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile , there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros .	6 1 28 29 285 13 23 28 157 24 2 50 51 6 1 6 0 1 4 87 7 6 1 10
Individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market .	0 1 11 0 0 1 93 120 35 13 70 7 6 1 10
The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order , but 2 % of the order 's value is an average , says Stephen Boesel , manager of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income mutual fund .	6 1 93 32 0 1 34 97 1 38 1 13 38 6 1 12 6 1 2 13 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 11 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 42 0 13 0 0 1 10
And assuming their first investment is successful , investors will have to pay taxes on their gains .	76 214 6 0 1 28 24 2 1 4 154 18 19 1 12 6 1 10
That can reduce returns by a third or more , once local taxes are included , Mr. Lipper says .	23 4 19 1 38 6 1 69 78 2 30 0 1 14 40 2 0 1 27 10
After that , individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well -- so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing .	59 23 2 0 1 11 6 80 66 6 0 1 23 11 4 35 79 35 1074 24 6 0 1 4 74 40 38 23 10
It 's very tough for most individuals to out-trade the mutual funds or the market , says Mr. Lipper .	192 197 29 24 198 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 13 6 1 2 56 0 1 10
You should really think twice if you think you can out-smart the system .	23 4 16 79 35 30 23 44 23 4 19 6 1 10
Then , too , many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market .	76 2 76 2 0 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 1 232 14 17 18 79 35 13 70 7 6 1 10
So what 's the best way to buy stocks ?	76 246 11 6 0 1 18 19 1 10
Unless an individual has a minimum of between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 to invest in stocks , he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks , in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker , says Mr. Lipper .	39 6 1 11 6 1 12 0 86 9 13 86 9 18 87 7 1 2 23 28 35 24 171 84 0 1 213 7 0 1 2 38 1 93 32 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 10
Still , he adds , I could see owning both , given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in spotting special situations based on their own insights , he adds .	76 2 23 44 2 23 4 168 32 23 2 130 66 1 16 11 6 1 12 0 1 93 32 0 1 70 7 6 0 1 2 23 27 10
George Douglas , first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to medium-size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects -- a traditional stomping ground for small investors .	0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 65 66 1 11 6 0 1 35 38 36 36 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
This growth sector , which usually carries a price\/earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard & Poor 's 500 , happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now .	6 0 1 2 33 16 11 6 0 1 69 92 1 112 6 0 0 1 42 1 2 64 18 19 23 12 6 1 42 36 0 1 67 35 10
It 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market , says Mr. Douglas .	23 37 35 45 7 6 1 29 24 84 6 1 2 56 0 1 10
Moreover , Mr. Douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term .	76 2 0 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 1 33 4 19 6 1 12 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
Many big Wall Street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now resuming coverage of this area , he notes .	0 0 0 0 0 1 33 11 6 0 1 12 1 12 0 0 1 6 0 1 26 37 35 32 1 12 6 1 2 23 27 10
We 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks , he says .	23 37 32 6 0 1 12 1 12 0 0 1 2 23 27 10
The pros strenuously advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad .	6 1 16 82 1 18 79 70 7 6 0 0 1 10
They say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle , when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes .	23 44 23 28 29 24 67 70 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 30 50 957 6 0 0 1 18 5 1 161 7 6 1 10
Friday 's correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity , but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle , says Carmine Grigoli , chief equity portfolio strategist at First Boston Corp .	1 42 1 595 6 36 0 0 1 2 13 282 23 35 79 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 533 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals , he says .	19 1 38 1 12 6 0 1 2 23 433 10
In the long run , investment advisers say , most investors will be better off using the dollar-cost averaging method of buying stocks .	59 6 0 1 2 0 1 44 2 0 1 4 115 189 171 32 6 0 0 1 93 32 1 10
In this method , a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down .	59 6 1 2 6 1 73 6 0 1 81 1 13 1 7 6 0 1 30 6 1 28 24 13 24 10
That cuts the risk , Mr. Gregory , the San Francisco money manager , points out .	23 11 6 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 2 27 185 10
When the market is low , you are buying more shares , and when it 's high , you 're buying fewer shares , he says .	39 6 1 28 24 2 23 37 32 0 1 2 13 39 23 28 24 2 23 37 32 0 1 2 23 27 10
Otherwise , if you put all your money in at one time , by sheer bad luck , you might pick a terrible time , and have to wait three years to get even , Mr. Gregory says .	76 2 39 23 11 6 78 1 35 38 0 1 2 59 36 0 1 2 23 4 19 6 0 1 2 13 154 18 154 67 35 18 115 24 2 0 1 27 10
A disciplined program will work the best , Mr. Boesel says .	6 0 1 4 79 81 1 2 0 1 27 10
One of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down , he says .	1 12 6 0 1 18 19 64 18 19 1 30 6 1 28 24 2 23 27 10
But that 's just the time when you should be buying them .	76 23 11 52 6 1 75 23 4 168 32 23 10

Donald Trump , who faced rising doubt about his bid for American Airlines parent AMR Corp. even before a United Airlines buy-out came apart Friday , withdrew his $ 7.54 billion offer .	0 1 2 33 11 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 67 30 6 0 0 1 28 24 35 2 11 6 125 0 9 1 10
Separately , bankers representing the group trying to buy United 's parent UAL Corp. met with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price , possibly around $ 250 a share , or $ 5.65 billion .	76 2 1 32 6 1 113 18 19 1 42 0 0 1 260 7 0 1 155 111 6 1 7 6 0 1 2 0 0 86 9 92 1 2 13 86 0 9 10
But a lower bid could face rejection by the UAL board .	76 6 0 1 4 19 1 12 6 0 1 10
Mr. Trump , who vowed Wednesday to go forward with the bid , said he was dropping it in light of the recent change in market conditions .	0 1 2 33 64 35 18 87 35 7 6 1 2 44 23 37 32 23 38 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
He said he might now sell his AMR stake , buy more shares , or make another offer at a lower price .	23 44 23 4 35 19 6 0 1 2 19 0 1 2 13 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
The Manhattan real-estate developer acted after the UAL buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $ 300-a-share bid , which sparked a selling panic among that snowballed into a 190-point drop Friday in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .	6 0 0 1 34 30 6 0 1 64 18 19 1 12 6 0 125 9 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 78 33 34 38 6 0 1 78 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
News about UAL and AMR , whose shares never reopened after trading was halted Friday for the UAL announcement , sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .	1 12 1 13 1 2 135 1 16 34 30 1 14 40 35 38 6 0 1 2 235 6 1 120 38 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
UAL tumbled $ 56.875 to $ 222.875 on volume of 2.3 million shares , and AMR declined by $ 22.125 to $ 76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands .	1 34 8 9 38 86 9 38 1 12 36 0 1 2 13 1 34 38 86 9 38 86 9 30 36 0 1 11 1 10
Together , the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders , and caused a 7.3 % drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average , second in size only to the stock-market crash of Oct. 19 , 1987 .	24 2 6 0 1 73 1 7 0 0 1 2 13 11 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 24 84 1 83 84 6 0 1 12 86 9 2 1 10
Some said Friday 's market debacle had given Mr. Trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the UAL deal .	23 44 1 42 0 1 20 114 0 1 6 1 18 87 161 7 6 1 33 11 1 12 1 67 30 1 34 38 6 0 1 10
After reaching an intraday high of $ 107.50 the day Mr. Trump disclosed his bid Oct. 5 , AMR 's stock had retreated as low as $ 97.75 last week .	181 32 6 0 1 12 86 9 81 1 0 1 11 6 1 613 9 2 1 42 1 20 164 29 53 7 86 9 67 35 10
Some takeover stock traders had been betting against Mr. Trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets , then selling at a profit without making a bid .	6 0 0 1 20 121 120 38 0 1 30 23 11 6 1 93 32 1 12 1 33 11 0 0 1 2 250 45 7 6 1 57 32 6 1 10
He still has n't proven his mettle as a big-league take-out artist , said airline analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley & Co .	23 16 20 35 21 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 56 0 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
He 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it .	23 20 21 6 1 75 23 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 13 16 79 70 7 23 10
He 's written this book , The Art of the Deal .	23 20 21 6 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 10
Why does n't he just follow through on one of these things ?	243 244 185 23 16 87 35 7 1 12 6 1 10
Mr. Trump withdrew his bid before the AMR board , which is due to meet tomorrow , ever formally considered it .	0 1 11 6 1 30 6 0 1 2 33 28 43 18 79 35 2 16 16 11 23 10
AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses , from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees , a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass , or both .	1 20 21 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 295 0 1 12 1 13 0 1 33 4 163 21 52 1 2 6 0 1 69 12 0 0 0 1 2 13 23 10
AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs .	1 20 35 94 18 19 0 1 38 1 57 45 7 1 33 4 163 21 6 1 12 6 0 1 18 19 0 1 10
Yesterday , Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress , saying it was rushing through a bill to protect AMR executives .	76 2 0 1 64 18 5 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 7 1 2 214 23 37 45 7 6 1 18 19 0 1 10
I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the UAL transaction , and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday , Mr. Trump wrote members of Congress .	23 65 66 6 80 66 1 12 6 1 4 74 16 40 48 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 40 81 0 1 2 0 1 381 1 12 1 10
AMR declined to comment , and Mr. Trump did n't respond to requests for interviews .	1 64 18 79 2 13 0 1 4 35 87 7 1 12 1 10
Mr. Trump never said how much AMR stock he had bought , only that his holdings were substantial .	0 1 16 162 539 24 0 1 23 20 21 2 185 104 6 1 28 24 10
However , he only received federal clearance to buy more than $ 15 million of the stock on Sept. 20 , when the price rose $ 2 a share to $ 78.50 .	76 2 23 16 11 0 1 18 19 24 227 86 0 9 12 6 1 38 86 9 2 75 6 1 34 8 9 294 1 38 86 9 10
Between then and his bid on Oct. 5 , the price fluctuated between $ 75.625 and $ 87.375 .	109 24 13 6 1 12 86 9 2 6 1 34 38 86 9 13 86 9 10
In an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play , Mr. Trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares .	59 6 1 18 543 1 66 6 1 11 35 52 6 0 1 2 0 1 64 67 35 18 19 6 1 57 32 6 1 10
AMR was trading at around $ 84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to about $ 76 .	1 37 45 7 0 86 9 35 38 6 0 1 2 16 16 34 38 0 86 9 10
Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 a share , and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ 76.50 .	207 66 23 11 6 0 0 1 12 86 9 92 1 2 13 214 23 4 35 79 30 6 1 11 6 1 2 0 1 4 168 120 38 6 0 1 38 6 1 12 86 9 10
Some analysts said AMR Chairman Robert Crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction , such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees .	6 1 44 0 0 0 1 4 19 6 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 18 19 6 1 42 0 1 38 6 0 1 2 69 12 6 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 10
However , other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the AMR board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps .	76 2 0 0 1 44 23 44 0 1 13 6 0 1 4 35 154 18 19 23 35 57 32 6 0 1 10
Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trump , whose towering ego had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out , might come back with a lower bid .	6 1 44 23 44 0 1 2 135 0 1 20 151 22 38 23 7 6 1 18 215 23 4 35 115 24 2 4 115 24 38 6 0 1 10
Ray Neidl of Dillon Read & Co. said Mr. Trump is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle .	0 1 12 0 0 0 1 44 0 1 37 156 24 13 565 198 6 1 18 79 10
I 'm sure he still wants AMR .	23 28 285 23 16 11 1 10
But others remained skeptical .	76 1 28 24 10
I was never sure Donald Trump really wanted to take AMR , said John Mattis , a bond analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .	23 28 35 285 0 1 16 64 18 19 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
What happened with United was a gracious way for him to bow out .	1226 48 7 1 11 6 0 302 198 23 18 115 24 10
Mr. Trump never obtained financing for his bid .	0 1 16 11 1 12 6 1 10
That skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would handicap him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight .	6 1 4 5 23 7 6 36 0 0 1 437 23 79 90 4 19 23 38 6 1 18 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
Meanwhile , Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. , the two lead lenders on the UAL buy-out , met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price .	76 2 1 13 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 48 7 0 1 35 18 79 30 23 4 115 43 18 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
Officials familiar with the talks said Citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $ 250 a share , but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made .	1 24 84 6 1 44 1 20 121 32 6 1 38 86 9 92 1 2 13 44 6 1 11 6 0 1 13 66 6 1 20 151 40 10
At $ 250 a share , the group would have to borrow about $ 6.1 billion from banks .	59 86 9 92 1 2 6 1 4 154 18 5 0 86 0 9 7 1 10
The first UAL deal unraveled after Citibank and Chase could n't raise $ 7.2 billion .	6 0 0 1 34 30 1 13 1 4 35 19 86 0 9 10
Citibank and Chase had agreed to commit $ 3 billion , and said they were highly confident of raising another $ 4.2 billion .	1 13 1 20 94 18 19 86 0 9 2 13 44 23 28 29 53 155 32 0 86 0 9 10
Together , Citicorp and Chase received $ 8 million in fees to raise the rest of the financing .	24 2 1 13 1 11 86 0 9 12 1 18 19 6 1 12 6 1 10
But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the UAL group was willing to pay them .	76 0 1 48 7 6 0 0 1 13 0 1 6 0 1 28 43 18 221 23 10
Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders .	76 413 6 1 43 18 87 35 7 6 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 153 6 1 12 0 1 10
The group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around .	6 1 42 1 64 18 115 285 23 11 0 0 1 81 0 1 123 10
Even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing , the transaction still faces obstacles .	137 39 6 0 1 28 43 18 19 1 2 6 1 16 11 1 10
UAL 's board could reject the new price as too low , especially since there are n't any competing bids .	1 42 1 4 19 6 0 1 140 29 24 2 67 30 50 51 35 6 0 1 10
Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , whose $ 275-a-share offer was rejected by UAL 's board , has n't shown signs of pursuing a $ 300-a-share back-up bid he made last month .	0 0 0 0 1 2 135 125 9 1 14 40 38 1 42 1 2 20 35 21 1 93 32 6 125 9 0 1 23 11 67 35 10
In addition , the coalition of labor and management , longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. Davis 's bid , could break apart now .	59 1 2 6 1 12 1 13 1 2 0 1 33 11 1 67 38 6 1 12 0 1 42 1 2 4 79 35 35 10
The group 's resilience gets its first test today when 30 top pilot union leaders convene outside Chicago in a previously scheduled meeting .	6 1 42 1 11 6 0 1 35 117 0 0 0 0 1 34 38 1 38 6 0 0 1 10
Union Chairman F.C . -LRB- Rick -RRB- Dubinsky faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved overwhelmingly last week .	0 0 0 10 314 1 167 1 11 6 0 1 93 427 55 1 64 18 19 6 1 6 1 11 35 67 35 10
The pilot union is vowing to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides .	6 0 1 37 113 18 19 6 1 471 6 1 11 10
But if the board rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives , it could transform what has been a harmonious process into an adversarial one .	76 39 6 1 11 6 0 1 13 64 18 19 0 1 2 23 4 5 118 20 21 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 10
The pilots could play hardball by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes .	6 1 4 19 1 57 214 23 28 53 7 6 1 13 1 30 23 4 154 18 19 6 1 10
If they were to insist on a low bid of , say $ 200 a share , the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose .	39 23 64 18 87 7 6 0 1 12 2 79 86 9 92 1 2 6 1 4 35 115 43 18 5 6 0 1 7 0 1 30 1 4 154 18 19 6 1 6 1 11 10
Also , because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots ' bid , the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders .	76 2 39 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 20 21 6 1 42 1 2 6 1 4 74 17 18 5 23 7 6 1 322 1 18 115 53 7 0 1 10
That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder .	23 4 221 23 6 1 18 19 6 1 13 16 19 6 0 1 10
