Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .	0 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 11 1 33 4 194 55 6 0 0 0 1 4 19 1 2 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 12 0 1 10
The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .	6 1 2 135 1 11 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 2 4 5 6 0 0 1 155 32 0 0 1 57 32 6 0 1 13 0 0 1 33 4 35 74 22 7 6 0 1 10
The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .	6 1 64 18 5 6 1 7 0 1 123 2 30 6 1 11 0 0 1 10
Such agency self-help borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .	52 0 0 1 28 24 13 24 2 29 29 24 84 0 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 2 6 1 42 0 1 10
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC .	6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 37 32 86 0 9 38 1 40 38 6 36 0 1 10
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit .	6 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 322 1 18 5 6 0 1 155 32 6 0 1 10
Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates .	0 86 0 9 4 74 40 38 0 1 2 33 11 0 0 1 10
But the RTC also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .	76 6 1 16 11 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 33 14 40 2 30 6 1 4 74 40 35 10
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .	6 1 4 74 40 35 30 6 1 14 40 2 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 38 86 0 9 2 13 86 0 9 12 1 12 0 1 10
It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC .	23 11 6 1 33 16 64 18 74 40 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 6 1 10
The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes .	6 1 20 35 21 0 86 0 9 32 0 0 1 2 13 23 28 43 18 19 13 19 1 38 6 1 6 1 34 10
Absent other working capital , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets .	126 0 0 1 2 23 44 2 6 1 4 74 17 18 19 0 0 1 30 1 4 74 40 57 32 6 0 1 10
We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , he said .	23 4 154 18 79 30 23 20 169 7 6 1 30 23 4 79 35 2 23 27 10
The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight .	6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 20 21 6 1 10
The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time .	6 1 4 134 6 1 18 338 7 6 1 0 0 86 0 9 38 6 1 10
Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds .	76 2 23 44 6 1 42 0 1 4 35 19 86 0 9 2 13 6 1 14 40 57 32 1 13 0 1 2 13 606 7 23 6 0 1 12 6 1 6 1 11 10
But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's working-capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed .	76 1 4 35 19 13 19 0 0 1 2 56 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 13 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 44 6 0 0 1 20 164 53 155 16 327 1 24 10
That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , he said .	6 1 48 7 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 13 1 2 33 28 38 23 116 29 24 2 23 27 10
The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility .	6 1 37 113 18 154 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 30 23 11 6 1 12 1 10
The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .	6 1 13 0 1 4 19 6 1 12 6 1 67 35 10
We 're about to see if advertising works .	23 37 113 18 194 55 1 34 10
Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .	122 7 6 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 13 6 1 33 20 60 2 6 0 0 0 1 37 32 35 0 1 32 6 0 1 238 79 35 120 2 6 1 1089 29 24 10
Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market , as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October	6 1 64 18 5 1 155 32 6 1 2 30 0 1 34 38 1 38 6 1 12 1
Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors .	0 1 567 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 11 35 1 18 19 1 10
This time around , they 're moving even faster .	103 1 105 2 23 37 120 67 35 10
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .	0 1 11 6 0 0 1 38 0 0 1 35 13 11 23 38 6 1 38 0 1 10
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .	0 1 11 0 1 38 1 35 2 13 11 6 0 1 120 35 10
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads .	0 0 0 1 85 0 1 20 35 21 0 0 1 10

The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .	6 0 1 11 6 1 81 0 1 208 2 117 0 1 11 6 0 1 13 11 6 1 38 6 1 10
This time , the firms were ready .	103 1 2 6 1 28 24 10
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge .	1 2 85 1 2 11 1 0 1 26 38 1 12 6 0 1 10
When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers .	39 6 1 48 7 6 0 1 67 35 2 6 0 1 11 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 52 52 6 1 10
The ads touted Fidelity 's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline , Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call .	6 1 11 1 42 0 1 38 6 0 1 2 1 28 53 7 6 1 10
A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .	6 0 1 44 6 1 2 33 16 37 120 13 138 0 1 4 35 87 7 2 11 62 52 6 0 1 12 1 38 6 1 10
A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , he says .	6 1 12 0 1 34 38 6 80 66 23 4 79 38 23 2 23 27 10
To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .	18 19 6 1 654 29 24 10
It would have been too late to think about on Friday .	23 4 163 164 686 24 18 87 7 38 1 10
We had to think about it ahead of time .	23 64 18 87 7 23 70 7 1 10
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity .	1 42 0 1 11 6 1 78 2 229 1 18 79 38 6 1 13 16 18 79 35 38 1 10
Underneath the headline Diversification , it counsels , Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility .	59 6 1 78 2 23 44 2 122 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 64 18 215 6 1 14 40 18 143 5 23 7 6 1 42 1 10
It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name .	23 469 24 18 19 6 0 0 0 1 38 1 10
PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .	1 16 28 43 18 79 35 35 35 68 6 0 1 10
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .	59 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 37 32 1 35 2 16 32 6 1 35 67 500 18 19 6 1 30 6 1 34 13 19 23 38 6 1 81 1 10
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last-minute creations .	23 16 11 6 1 12 0 0 1 12 124 1 4 154 18 19 6 0 1 10
The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish .	6 0 0 1 2 40 38 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 11 0 1 2 1 12 6 36 0 29 24 0 1 2 156 29 24 10
Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... .	40 67 30 6 1 34 35 2 23 11 0 1 214 2 23 73 6 1 35 155 45 7 6 36 0 1 106 10
We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation .	23 64 18 77 66 6 0 1 11 35 6 1 18 79 38 0 1 10
The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night .	6 1 14 17 18 79 67 35 38 1 67 35 10
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks .	1 11 6 36 0 1 2 32 0 1 10
Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market .	76 2 23 48 155 16 229 6 1 33 11 6 1 18 19 6 1 38 6 1 10
We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .	23 37 214 6 0 1 138 23 4 19 64 18 344 6 1 79 35 13 19 23 2 90 16 11 6 1 35 35 2 56 0 1 2 1 42 1 12 1 10
If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed .	39 23 11 23 13 11 23 35 2 6 0 1 20 35 60 10
He adds , This is n't 1987 revisited .	23 44 2 23 11 35 1 40 10
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach .	347 6 1 120 13 16 156 126 24 25 0 1 76 2 0 1 64 18 35 19 6 1 10
At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon .	59 0 1 2 1 108 0 0 1 0 1 13 7 6 1 2 16 64 18 79 67 35 10
The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's easy-to-film , black-and-white Where We Stand commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 .	6 1 20 94 18 19 1 12 1 42 0 2 0 55 23 34 1242 2 33 20 121 120 35 38 1 12 0 1 38 1 10
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , Leadership by Example .	6 1 4 163 60 38 6 0 1 35 2 32 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 2 1 12 1 10
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad .	76 59 6 1 39 6 1 34 35 2 0 1 64 16 18 493 24 7 6 0 1 10
We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said .	23 4 35 215 38 6 1 23 64 18 74 40 10
The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait-and-see attitude , says Cathleen B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing .	6 1 64 18 168 120 35 91 23 37 32 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 1 10
In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .	59 6 1 2 6 0 1 37 35 120 35 18 19 0 1 30 23 34 38 6 1 12 1 10
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .	76 192 1243 18 74 40 55 6 1 4 115 116 29 24 10
In 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse .	59 1 2 59 6 1 12 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 1 34 38 6 1 67 35 10
Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .	76 6 1 4 19 6 1 18 77 66 1 4 79 81 1 208 10

Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend .	1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 13 6 0 0 1 48 35 7 6 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 67 35 10
The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year 's tournament .	6 1 33 73 1 38 6 1 7 6 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 14 22 7 0 1 38 0 1 38 6 0 0 0 1 2 6 1 33 20 151 172 7 35 38 6 0 0 1 13 0 1 38 0 1 42 1 10

That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week .	66 23 11 6 0 0 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 2 78 69 78 112 1 112 6 1 2 1244 23 4 19 6 1 123 120 2 13 59 6 1 6 0 1 37 120 2 23 4 35 19 6 1 10
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest .	6 1 48 7 0 1 2 6 1 33 11 0 1 18 221 6 1 52 6 1 13 0 1 38 0 1 38 1 42 1 10
Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before , marveled Giant manager Roger Craig .	6 1 23 136 29 24 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 78 2 56 0 0 0 1 10
He 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat .	23 11 6 1 33 11 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 33 48 7 6 1 30 23 34 38 6 0 1 10
The upshot of the downshoot is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest .	6 1 12 6 1 65 66 6 0 1 34 38 0 1 42 0 1 35 180 0 1 12 1 7 6 0 1 10
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all .	6 1 18 87 7 35 65 66 0 1 217 0 1 12 1 217 1 167 33 11 0 0 1 64 35 18 19 23 78 10
That 's not an average to soothe Giant rooters .	23 11 35 6 1 18 19 0 1 10
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than Desire , do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm .	1 4 77 66 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 15 1 75 23 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 515 185 23 79 10 167 4 163 164 53 7 6 1 2 13 23 11 23 38 0 1 10
Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .	1 12 6 0 1 34 67 35 208 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 13 39 23 11 6 1 13 11 6 1 2 1 28 29 24 2 248 148 67 35 117 23 4 79 10
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams .	6 0 1 16 34 35 32 1 32 6 1 13 1 12 6 1 10
I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .	23 48 7 6 1 35 2 13 67 30 23 34 35 10
I love 'em both .	23 11 23 78 10
The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games , said David Williams , a Sacramento septuagenarian , at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go .	6 0 1 23 37 45 7 592 198 6 1 18 19 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 153 6 1 153 1 42 1 10
The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility .	6 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 13 1 10
I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .	23 64 18 215 23 11 6 1 2 30 23 16 48 7 6 80 66 52 52 23 12 1 2 12 6 0 1 13 1 2 48 35 7 0 1 10
Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .	134 23 18 77 66 39 23 11 6 0 0 0 1 2 13 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 75 76 2 23 28 24 167 2 23 4 19 0 1 38 6 0 1 18 19 0 1 2 13 52 6 1 4 19 6 1 10
Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for .	76 2 6 0 1 108 23 6 1 12 1 18 87 7 10
In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery .	59 6 0 1 2 59 1 13 1 2 50 51 0 1 2 6 0 2 0 1 33 20 139 6 0 1 12 6 1 7 0 1 10
He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game two -RRB- , moved a runner along in the A 's three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally .	23 28 24 35 38 1 12 1 123 167 2 11 6 1 35 38 6 0 0 0 0 1 2 13 34 38 6 1 42 0 1 10
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph .	24 145 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 104 39 23 11 6 0 0 0 1 67 35 2 6 1 33 11 23 64 18 5 6 1 35 7 23 38 1 12 6 1 10
Not his autograph ; power-hitter McGwire 's .	52 6 1 91 0 0 1 10
An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation .	6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 11 0 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run .	23 11 1 38 6 1 38 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 13 11 23 57 156 24 38 6 1 35 2 102 13 120 2 32 6 1 13 32 6 1 10
When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , he lectured .	39 23 48 7 6 1 2 23 11 6 1 35 2 23 27 10
The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters .	6 0 1 12 6 1 11 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 1 10
They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs .	23 34 38 0 1 2 0 0 1 13 0 1 40 35 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
They went a collective 5-for-24 here , with zero homers and ribbies .	23 11 6 0 1 35 2 38 0 1 13 1 10
It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come .	192 233 6 0 1 12 1 2 69 230 7 23 24 2 33 108 6 1 1 12 6 0 1 18 79 10
I believe in the law of averages , declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two .	23 48 7 6 1 12 1 2 56 0 0 0 0 0 1 153 1 123 10
I 'd rather see a so-so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold .	23 4 35 344 6 0 1 33 28 24 79 35 38 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 33 28 24 10
But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side .	76 6 0 0 1 16 11 6 1 54 55 0 1 4 87 7 6 1 10
When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , he said .	39 23 34 2 23 16 162 55 23 4 178 23 24 2 23 27 10
That 's baseball .	23 11 1 10
NCR Corp. reported a 10 % drop in third-quarter net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip .	0 1 11 6 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 32 0 1 33 82 6 0 0 1 18 79 10
Net income for the quarter fell to $ 93.1 million from $ 103.1 million , roughly what analysts had expected .	0 1 12 6 1 34 38 86 0 9 38 86 0 9 2 67 471 1 20 21 10
But per-share profit dropped only 2 % to $ 1.23 a share from $ 1.26 a share , as the company continued its stock buy-back plan .	76 0 1 34 96 67 35 38 86 9 92 1 38 86 9 92 1 2 30 6 1 11 6 0 0 1 10

Revenue fell 1 % to $ 1.39 billion from $ 1.41 billion .	1 34 67 35 38 86 0 9 38 86 0 9 10
The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will adversely affect its fourth-quarter performance and make it difficult to better 1988 results .	6 0 1 2 33 11 24 61 52 6 1 38 6 1 2 16 44 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 4 16 19 6 0 1 13 446 192 24 18 19 0 1 10
NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .	1 44 1 34 67 38 6 1 13 35 2 32 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The company , however , said orders in the U.S. showed good gains during the latest quarter .	6 1 2 16 2 44 1 12 6 1 11 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR 's major customers .	1 73 6 1 7 0 1 132 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 23 45 7 0 1 40 38 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .	59 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 1 2 33 11 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 14 35 40 38 6 0 13 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 33 20 35 35 164 24 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said .	6 1 2 230 7 6 0 1 2 4 16 19 6 0 1 42 1 2 1 27 10
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of $ 149.6 million , or $ 1.85 a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion .	59 6 0 0 1 2 1 11 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 2 38 1 12 86 0 9 10
Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ 5.35 a share from $ 5.50 a share .	0 1 44 23 11 6 0 1 12 1 38 86 9 92 1 38 86 9 92 1 10
Revenue projections were slashed to $ 6.03 billion from $ 6.20 billion .	0 1 14 40 38 86 0 9 38 86 0 9 10

Revenues declined 1 % to $ 4.17 billion from $ 4.19 billion .	1 34 67 35 38 86 0 9 38 86 0 9 10
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NCR shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 57 .	59 0 0 0 0 0 1 76 2 0 1 64 67 35 18 87 7 86 9 10
Concerning your Sept. 19 article Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance , I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world .	32 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 73 1 42 1 7 1 2 23 28 266 66 0 1 37 35 45 35 7 6 0 2 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ?	39 6 1 28 24 2 76 2 712 5 6 1 7 6 0 2 0 1 135 1 18 79 38 6 1 28 24 38 1 10
Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ?	712 185 5 6 0 0 1 7 6 0 1 2 13 221 1 6 0 1 12 0 1 22 309 539 24 1 23 11 38 6 1 38 6 1 10
That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .	23 4 19 6 1 12 1 2 13 19 6 0 1 40 35 38 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 10

For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that started nervously in the small hours .	59 1 12 1 42 0 1 2 23 11 6 1 33 34 35 38 6 0 1 10
By lunchtime , the selling was at near-panic fever .	59 1 2 6 1 48 7 0 1 10
But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street-inspired rally , the City breathed a sigh of relief .	76 39 6 1 34 38 6 0 0 0 1 2 6 1 11 6 1 12 1 10
So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district .	76 23 34 35 38 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered especially vulnerable .	59 6 1 12 0 1 42 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 14 152 29 24 10
And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be .	76 59 6 1 12 1 69 78 2 6 1 48 7 0 1 12 1 38 6 1 230 309 531 24 6 1 4 115 10

And it left mixed signals for London .	76 23 11 0 1 38 1 10
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading .	0 1 28 179 6 0 13 0 0 1 7 0 1 91 0 0 1 34 67 35 38 0 1 10
At Jefferies ' trading room on Finsbury Circus , a stately circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index .	59 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 10
Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at 2076.8 , off 157.1 points , or 7 % .	137 76 2 6 1 11 6 1 2 35 459 35 2 30 6 1 48 7 1 2 38 0 1 2 13 0 1 10
I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , said Mr. Palamara , a big , good-humored New York native who runs the 15-trader office .	23 11 1 2 13 23 4 35 19 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 2 0 0 0 1 33 11 6 0 1 10

This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , said David Smith , who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks .	23 11 35 6 1 12 1 18 5 6 0 1 7 2 56 0 1 2 33 11 1 12 6 0 1 10
We tend to run a very tight book .	23 64 18 19 6 36 0 1 10
Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers .	1 11 1 12 6 1 38 6 1 113 18 19 1 13 1 2 13 50 51 35 0 1 10

For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette .	59 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 230 7 0 1 11 6 0 1 18 19 6 1 10
On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 .	59 6 1 2 36 0 0 0 1 34 2 13 6 1 20 21 6 0 1 13 28 126 0 1 10
Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , Mr. Smith said .	337 1 4 35 79 2 344 1 19 35 6 0 1 2 0 1 433 10
He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes .	23 11 0 1 12 1 13 11 6 1 18 19 35 38 6 1 0 1 42 0 1 10
The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence , -LRB- $ 13.27 -RRB- and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out feelers .	6 0 0 1 73 6 0 1 7 0 1 2 12 86 9 167 13 0 1 42 1 37 32 35 1 10

By this time , it was 4:30 a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break .	59 6 1 2 23 11 0 1 38 0 1 2 13 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 32 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 33 20 121 32 1 12 6 1 67 38 1 42 0 0 0 1 10

By midday , the London market was in full retreat .	59 1 2 6 0 1 48 7 0 1 10

France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could calculate the index , which you could n't , Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said early in the afternoon .	1 136 6 1 24 2 38 305 148 0 1 117 23 4 19 6 1 2 471 23 11 35 2 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 27 369 7 6 1 10

Ambassador Paul Nitze 's statement -LRB- Notable & Quotable , Sept. 20 -RRB- , If you have a million people working for you , every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year , is a pretty negative way of looking at things .	0 0 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 2 340 9 167 2 39 23 11 6 0 1 120 38 23 2 6 0 1 33 11 0 1 12 6 1 93 156 24 4 115 24 460 148 208 294 1 2 11 6 36 0 1 93 45 7 1 10

The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines .	6 0 0 1 11 6 1 33 4 221 6 0 1 1 18 19 13 19 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday .	6 0 1 18 19 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 2 11 0 1 12 6 1 2 40 35 13 40 38 6 1 38 6 0 1 35 10
The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged .	6 1 14 17 18 74 40 35 38 6 0 1 13 0 1 35 2 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 74 40 10
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines .	6 1 11 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 33 16 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 10
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal .	59 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 2 0 1 73 6 1 7 6 0 1 18 19 6 1 12 1 2 13 44 23 48 7 6 1 12 6 1 10
Elaine Chao , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill in its present form .	0 1 2 0 0 1 2 16 11 6 1 18 19 6 1 42 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing .	0 1 73 35 0 1 42 1 7 6 1 237 6 0 1 120 10
He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is wiggle room in the administration 's position .	23 16 44 6 80 66 6 0 1 20 35 169 7 0 0 0 1 44 50 51 0 1 38 6 1 42 1 10
Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .	0 1 13 0 0 1 16 65 66 6 1 11 35 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .	76 23 11 6 0 13 0 1 38 1 18 79 35 18 19 6 1 10
Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation .	1 69 12 6 1 13 1 44 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 28 35 43 18 19 1 18 19 6 1 10
It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , said one Senate aide .	23 48 35 7 6 0 1 13 23 16 64 18 19 23 2 56 0 0 1 10
The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out .	6 1 14 22 155 32 6 80 66 6 1 4 19 0 0 1 18 19 35 6 1 40 38 6 0 1 10
Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit .	76 2 6 0 1 4 35 19 36 0 1 12 0 1 2 13 4 19 6 0 1 93 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 6 1 136 24 10
Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .	1 12 6 1 73 6 1 7 6 1 18 5 1 13 1 7 6 0 1 2 13 18 19 6 1 13 1 12 6 1 10
In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired .	109 24 2 6 1 4 221 6 0 1 6 0 0 1 30 0 1 69 78 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 4 74 40 10
It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .	23 16 4 134 6 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 13 18 19 6 1 24 399 32 6 1 12 6 1 10
The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .	6 1 4 134 6 1 18 19 6 1 30 0 1 20 35 151 40 2 13 30 6 1 28 43 18 19 6 1 35 2 87 7 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 38 1 12 1 2 13 5 1 7 6 0 1 10
If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days .	39 0 1 14 40 2 6 1 4 19 1 18 19 6 0 1 67 35 10
All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service .	52 6 1 2 52 1 13 0 1 2 11 1 12 6 1 322 1 18 5 1 155 45 35 7 0 1 38 6 1 12 0 2 0 1 10
But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge .	76 0 0 1 34 2 23 32 0 1 42 80 66 6 1 12 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 10
One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies .	1 12 6 0 1 40 38 6 1 65 66 0 1 4 74 22 155 111 23 7 0 1 13 32 0 0 1 10
In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members , a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow .	59 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 13 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 44 1 12 6 0 1 4 87 7 23 35 10
It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , said Doug Hammond , the mediator , who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations .	23 4 19 6 0 1 13 23 4 19 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 2 33 108 6 1 18 79 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 10

DPC holds a 7.8 % stake in Dataproducts and made a $ 15-a-share bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ 283.7 million proposal unacceptable .	1 11 6 36 0 1 12 1 13 11 6 125 9 1 12 6 1 38 1 2 13 0 1 136 6 125 0 9 1 24 10

They all went in the wrong direction , said Andreas Insam , an investment adviser for the Bank in Liechtenstein 's Frankfurt branch .	23 78 34 38 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 10

After the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders , Frankfurt 's normal two-hour trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume .	39 6 1 14 40 67 35 70 7 6 1 12 0 1 2 1 42 0 0 0 1 14 40 67 35 18 19 6 0 1 10

It took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market .	23 11 1 12 6 1 30 0 1 4 74 40 35 18 19 6 1 12 6 1 10
Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices .	0 1 13 1 2 23 12 361 34 81 1 208 38 6 1 32 0 0 1 2 28 29 24 38 6 0 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors .	23 28 35 24 2 38 0 0 1 10
That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors , said Norbert Braeuer , a senior trader for Hessische Landesbank .	23 162 55 23 14 188 1 40 38 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up lower-priced shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting .	6 0 1 2 12 1 2 37 32 35 0 1 38 1 2 13 0 1 64 18 19 118 4 79 38 0 1 57 120 10
But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on Sept. 8 .	76 137 39 0 1 64 18 79 2 1 78 44 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 33 16 37 32 1 12 1 30 6 1 20 60 38 6 0 1 12 1 38 86 9 10

A 16.3 % drop for Mannesmann AG and Dresdner Bank AG 's 9.6 % decline were especially problematic for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in jeopardy .	6 36 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 0 1 42 36 0 1 28 29 53 7 6 0 1 2 135 1 217 0 0 1 12 1 4 35 87 7 1 10

Yet yesterday 's market cropped Dresdner 's share price by 33 marks to 309 marks a share , leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly .	76 1 42 1 11 1 42 0 1 38 0 1 38 0 1 92 1 2 32 0 302 198 1 18 87 7 6 0 1 30 6 1 34 35 10

Brokers said that as the news spread that Wall Street was moving up , traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in mid-conversation , ordering buys instead .	1 65 66 39 6 1 34 30 0 1 37 120 35 2 1 33 20 60 18 19 0 1 11 6 1 38 1 2 32 1 35 10

J.P. Morgan & Co .	0 0 0 1 10
J.P.

The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves .	6 0 1 11 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 38 6 0 0 0 1 33 20 21 52 6 0 0 13 0 1 12 0 1 38 1 10

George M. Salem , analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , called the results mildly disappointing .	0 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 2 136 6 1 29 24 10
Excluding the $ 2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr. Salem said .	32 6 125 0 9 1 13 45 7 6 1 1 11 2 1 11 36 0 1 92 1 2 0 1 27 10

Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said .	1 11 86 0 9 12 0 1 12 6 0 13 0 0 1 91 165 23 121 32 1 2 0 0 1 4 163 164 131 0 9 24 38 6 1 2 1 27 10
Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period .	52 1 12 1 16 28 53 46 24 2 146 6 1 86 0 9 12 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million , reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities .	1 12 1 24 84 1 34 67 35 38 86 0 9 2 32 0 0 13 0 1 13 1 12 1 12 0 1 10
These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related income , the bank said .	6 1 14 16 40 38 0 0 1 2 6 1 27 10
Non-interest expenses grew 16 % to $ 496 million .	0 1 34 67 35 38 86 0 9 10
NCNB Corp .	0 1 10
NCNB Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's Texas operations .	0 1 42 0 1 24 141 34 38 6 1 2 67 70 7 0 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 10

The latest quarter included a gain of $ 56.1 million , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .	6 0 1 11 6 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 92 1 2 24 84 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10

Included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ 33 million loan , which NCNB said it expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter .	22 7 6 1 12 6 36 0 1 472 6 125 0 9 1 2 138 1 44 23 82 18 74 16 40 2 38 6 1 2 70 7 6 0 1 10
The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in NCNB 's Southeast operations , as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign .	6 1 12 0 1 11 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 2 102 102 13 6 36 0 1 12 1 45 7 6 0 0 1 10
The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze NCNB 's net interest margin in the Southeast to 3.38 % from 3.80 % a year earlier .	6 0 1 40 38 1 16 4 19 1 42 0 0 1 12 6 1 38 0 1 38 0 1 6 1 353 10

Security Pacific Corp .	0 0 1 10
Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans .	0 1 42 0 1 34 38 6 0 1 2 13 6 0 0 0 0 1 28 35 43 18 19 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 70 7 0 1 12 0 0 13 0 1 10

The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans .	6 1 44 6 1 48 35 7 6 125 0 9 1 12 0 0 1 2 32 6 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 158 29 24 167 2 13 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 10

As a result , Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings .	59 6 1 2 0 1 42 0 0 1 34 96 67 67 35 2 81 36 0 1 68 6 0 1 12 1 2 33 20 121 32 36 0 1 10

Security Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ 30.4 million , because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before .	0 1 42 0 1 28 126 0 1 2 13 86 0 9 2 30 23 48 7 6 0 1 6 1 26 10

McCaw 's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN .	1 42 0 0 1 4 134 1 18 19 6 0 1 38 1 123 90 4 5 35 0 1 7 6 0 1 29 24 84 119 6 0 1 4 35 154 18 5 7 23 12 1 10
LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses .	1 37 229 1 18 19 6 0 1 2 33 11 6 1 12 0 1 13 1 18 19 6 0 1 10

The LIN board said holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that guarantees private market value after five years for the remaining shares .	6 0 1 44 1 4 74 40 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 33 11 0 0 1 38 0 1 38 6 0 1 10

If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. fish-processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .	39 6 1 14 35 40 38 1 2 23 44 2 6 1 4 19 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 24 84 1 84 6 1 40 38 0 0 1 12 1 13 6 0 1 10

The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index .	6 0 1 11 6 0 0 0 1 13 34 35 38 36 0 1 38 0 1 2 30 6 0 0 1 42 0 0 1 20 60 67 35 2 13 96 67 35 68 6 0 0 1 10

It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 ; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide adequate funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- FmHA -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and localities ; and fully fund the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million potpourri for the homeless .	23 4 154 18 5 6 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 7 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 70 155 111 23 7 86 9 91 19 166 13 16 19 167 0 0 1 13 19 6 1 12 0 1 91 19 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 91 19 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 167 91 19 0 0 13 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 13 0 1 2 12 86 0 9 12 0 1 12 1 13 1 91 13 16 19 6 0 1 2 6 125 0 9 1 12 6 1 10
Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen .	0 0 1 12 0 1 20 164 29 24 38 6 1 2 13 16 14 40 38 6 1 12 0 1 13 1 2 196 40 38 6 0 0 1 2 13 1 10
Indirect subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better .	0 1 2 85 6 1 2 85 1 2 28 29 24 10
Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in no cost to the government , the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- to the single-family home market would result in a major expense .	39 0 1 44 32 0 1 4 87 7 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 13 12 0 1 12 1 166 69 12 1 167 12 6 0 0 1 4 87 7 6 0 1 10

The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion .	6 1 78 11 86 0 9 38 0 1 91 6 1 42 1 12 6 1 2 52 6 0 1 2 34 38 0 86 0 9 10
The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended .	6 0 1 20 94 18 5 35 86 0 9 7 6 0 0 1 38 1 18 178 6 1 24 13 6 1 11 6 0 86 0 9 38 6 0 1 16 40 10

In its nicely produced publication Where Will Our Children Live ? the NAHB does acknowledge that of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government .	59 6 36 0 1 394 244 6 1 79 10 6 1 4 77 66 59 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 35 74 40 38 6 0 1 10

But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls .	76 39 6 1 20 21 1 138 1 13 1 4 19 18 19 0 1 2 6 1 20 21 6 0 0 1 158 53 7 2 79 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 106 18 19 0 1 10

Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending .	39 6 1 64 18 19 35 6 0 1 2 45 7 0 1 2 6 1 18 5 1 7 0 13 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 1 75 6 1 12 0 0 1 37 120 10
Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling Federal Reserve tightness ; and the Bush administration 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax .	1 12 0 1 11 35 6 1 2 38 1 35 417 294 36 0 1 1250 0 1 2 32 0 0 1 91 13 6 0 1 1251 662 24 10 167 1 1252 113 18 19 6 0 1 10
As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write .	109 24 2 0 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 30 0 0 1 406 23 16 19 6 1 138 1 11 10
What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is drying up .	118 16 11 6 1 12 0 1 2 16 2 11 6 0 80 66 2 59 6 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 37 120 35 10
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly margined investments in the deal stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing .	0 1 11 6 1 69 12 6 0 1 2 102 13 6 0 1 2 30 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 123 12 6 1 12 0 1 10

A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured , the target 's stock price was not affected on Friday .	6 0 1 65 66 39 0 1 20 151 40 2 6 1 42 0 1 14 35 40 38 1 10
The multibillion-dollar prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and\/or issue billions in high-yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated .	6 0 1 2 75 6 1 4 19 35 6 1 12 1 13 19 1 12 0 1 2 162 55 6 1 14 40 10
The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks .	6 1 12 0 0 1 20 121 111 6 1 7 1 42 0 1 38 0 1 10
The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities .	6 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 1 2 69 12 0 1 2 0 1 2 13 1 42 0 1 2 20 139 6 1 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring .	1 20 60 57 32 0 1 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 13 57 229 1 18 19 35 6 0 0 1 13 1 10
As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times .	59 6 1 2 0 0 1 20 60 38 6 1 13 6 0 1 113 18 19 86 0 9 12 0 1 38 1 37 32 0 1 10
These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen is the market reining them in .	23 11 35 0 1 93 32 35 6 0 1 138 6 0 1 73 7 1 38 1 167 2 13 119 23 20 21 235 6 1 32 23 35 10
Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday .	59 1 2 1 20 35 164 24 38 6 1 45 35 7 6 1 2 13 6 1 18 79 38 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 4 35 5 23 7 6 0 0 1 33 48 7 1 38 1 10
If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ?	39 23 28 24 18 77 66 1 12 0 1 13 1 11 0 1 2 246 11 6 1 12 0 1 10
After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators .	76 105 2 6 0 1 42 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 4 74 17 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 10
Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's bashing of Wall Street ?	405 23 6 1 75 0 1 37 45 7 1 42 1 12 0 1 10
Absolutely not .	29 24 10
To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior .	59 6 1 75 1 42 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 6 1 65 66 0 1 13 6 0 1 28 29 53 155 32 6 0 1 13 1 38 0 1 10
The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings .	6 0 0 1 14 72 16 40 278 6 0 1 12 1 13 1 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 0 1 10
The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 11 6 1 93 278 6 0 1 79 10
If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions .	39 0 1 28 24 2 39 0 1 28 29 24 2 76 6 0 1 4 19 6 1 67 35 13 35 1253 206 0 1 2 13 6 1 4 154 38 0 1 18 19 0 1 10
Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year .	76 2 6 0 1 20 169 35 7 6 1 2 13 23 11 6 1 35 81 1 10
Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites .	137 76 2 23 16 34 10
The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily .	6 1 13 0 1 14 40 38 0 1 2 30 6 0 1 12 0 1 34 35 10
If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington .	39 23 48 7 6 0 1 2 23 4 77 66 0 13 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 28 29 43 18 87 7 6 1 213 7 1 10
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated .	39 23 48 7 6 1 13 1 2 23 16 28 43 18 87 7 0 1 213 7 1 2 30 6 0 1 4 35 74 40 10
The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics .	6 1 44 2 1 11 1 35 68 1 10
Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm .	39 6 0 1 14 35 16 22 67 35 7 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 32 0 0 1 2 0 1 4 35 19 0 1 10
Any such attempt to distinguish good debt from bad debt , or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .	6 0 1 18 5 0 1 7 0 1 2 13 18 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 2 69 12 6 1 2 28 43 18 19 6 1 138 6 0 1 12 1 11 67 38 0 1 13 0 1 12 1 10
Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end .	137 76 198 0 1 18 87 7 6 1 12 1 2 1 13 6 1 2 23 12 23 836 90 64 16 18 79 10

Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York .	1 16 28 29 24 38 1 2 67 38 1 2 30 1 13 6 0 0 1 11 6 1 30 1 64 18 79 38 0 1 10

All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since Friday 's 190.58-point plunge on Wall Street .	6 1 48 7 1 38 6 1 30 23 11 6 0 0 1 18 79 12 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 10
But rather than set the tone for other markets , Japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines .	76 137 475 19 6 1 38 0 1 2 1 42 0 0 1 64 18 79 38 6 1 10
Still , despite the sudden reappearance of stock-market turbulence , managers of Japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload U.S. or European equities .	76 2 59 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 44 23 37 35 113 18 19 0 13 0 1 10

The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that .	6 1 28 266 66 0 1 4 115 24 18 19 0 1 140 24 2 13 50 51 0 1 12 6 1 75 6 0 1 37 120 38 6 1 18 19 0 1 10
But in the absence of panicky trading , its presence was never overtly felt .	76 59 6 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 14 35 16 40 10
At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69 , down 647.33 points , or 1.8 % .	59 6 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 48 7 1 2 38 0 1 2 13 0 1 10

A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day 's low .	6 0 1 1254 23 24 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 13 6 1 34 38 6 1 2 13 6 1 34 38 6 1 42 1 10

Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply .	0 1 13 1 11 80 66 6 0 1 4 35 79 67 35 10
But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago , during the October 1987 global stock market crash .	76 6 1 4 19 6 1 12 1 158 0 1 3 2 12 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 10
On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop .	59 86 9 2 123 12 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 106 6 0 0 1 34 67 35 2 13 1 34 38 1 38 6 36 0 1 10
This time , Wall Street 's plunge of 6.9 % Friday was followed by yesterday 's 1.8 % loss in Tokyo .	103 1 2 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 78 14 40 38 1 42 36 0 1 12 1 10
Two years ago , Tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after New York 's 22.6 % Black Monday plunge , when the Nikkei average fell 14.9 % .	0 1 234 2 1 42 0 1 34 81 1 68 0 1 42 36 0 0 0 1 2 117 6 0 1 34 67 35 10
Thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street 's opening .	76 2 0 1 16 37 110 24 35 7 0 1 42 1 10
But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market .	76 59 0 1 76 2 6 0 0 0 1 64 35 18 87 7 1 38 0 1 12 0 1 2 30 0 1 16 11 0 1 38 6 0 1 10

Isao Ushikubo , general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic .	0 1 2 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 2 16 28 24 10
He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a fleeting event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .	23 73 1 42 1 12 6 1 7 6 0 1 45 38 1 7 0 1 13 0 1 10
Unless there is a panic , this is the best time to buy , as was the case two years ago , he said .	39 50 51 6 1 2 23 11 6 0 1 18 79 2 297 206 6 1 0 1 421 2 23 27 10
Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact .	6 1 33 20 21 1 38 0 1 14 22 7 0 1 2 13 137 76 694 0 1 14 40 2 50 51 35 0 1 10
Other fund managers were similarly sanguine .	0 0 1 28 29 24 10
We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , said Masato Murakami , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co .	23 11 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 10

Bangkok , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses .	1 2 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 34 38 36 0 1 10
Brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market .	1 13 0 1 44 6 1 42 1 37 45 7 1 42 0 0 1 67 30 6 1 28 53 7 0 1 69 12 0 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 10

Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead .	1 12 6 1 14 35 16 22 7 0 1 2 13 6 1 16 48 7 0 1 2 13 50 51 6 80 66 1 37 35 32 1 42 1 10

Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , said Elizabeth Hambrecht , a regional analyst with Baring Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd .	1 11 6 1 30 39 1 64 18 79 35 2 23 64 18 79 30 6 1 34 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 253 0 1 167 1 10

Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California .	0 0 1 14 17 18 163 174 35 66 39 23 73 6 1 7 6 1 2 23 24 4 79 35 38 1 10
We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place .	23 20 35 174 66 0 1 11 1 42 1 2 13 76 6 1 42 0 1 37 113 18 19 6 1 33 108 23 52 6 0 1 10
What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ?	454 1 1160 23 18 5 7 6 0 0 1 16 40 38 0 0 0 1 13 40 38 6 1 42 0 1 10
If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty .	218 40 38 6 1 2 6 36 0 1 4 19 35 0 1 2 19 0 0 1 38 0 1 2 19 0 0 1 2 19 1 17 18 19 6 0 1 2 13 19 6 0 0 0 1 22 7 6 125 0 9 1 18 19 6 1 13 1 23 232 37 156 29 24 10
The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment .	6 1 14 22 35 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 13 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one .	76 2 6 0 0 1 37 32 23 18 5 7 6 1 10
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed .	62 52 1 13 6 1 4 79 30 6 1 34 10
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards .	6 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 33 4 35 19 6 1 42 1 10
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market .	0 0 1 13 0 0 1 4 154 18 79 13 19 35 6 0 1 10
In other words , California is presuming to take control of the nation 's farm policy .	59 0 1 2 1 37 113 18 19 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 10
As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality .	109 24 6 0 1 42 1 14 22 7 0 1 10
Consider the greenhouse-effect provision .	19 6 0 1 10
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .	6 0 1 4 19 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 10
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem .	137 39 23 48 7 6 0 0 1 2 192 383 24 66 1 12 6 0 1 4 19 6 1 12 118 14 22 7 6 0 1 10
But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?	76 39 0 1 13 1 11 23 18 5 7 6 0 0 1 2 246 37 120 35 10
The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit .	6 0 1 18 79 85 6 1 48 7 6 1 12 124 6 1 78 4 79 10
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp .	6 1 16 11 6 1 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10
He 's running for governor .	23 37 45 7 1 10
Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 .	0 0 0 1 11 6 1 33 73 6 1 7 6 0 0 0 1 13 73 23 7 6 0 0 1 18 74 40 38 6 1 38 1 38 86 9 2 123 10
That 's also the day of the gubernatorial election .	23 11 35 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money .	6 1 64 18 163 151 40 18 19 52 6 0 1 33 11 35 6 0 0 1 33 11 1 10
And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits .	76 23 82 0 0 0 1 18 87 7 0 0 1 10
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is gravy .	23 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 91 52 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 166 12 124 50 51 6 1 167 11 1 10
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback .	6 1 37 182 15 6 0 1 2 13 76 23 4 74 15 6 0 1 10
-LRB- The Republican candidate , Sen. Pete Wilson , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his own crime initiative . -RRB-	166 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 37 32 6 0 0 1 35 2 32 6 0 0 1 10 167
While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through .	39 23 28 24 30 6 0 0 1 4 74 152 24 2 192 383 35 208 24 66 59 0 1 23 4 115 24 10
This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative .	23 11 6 1 33 16 11 6 0 0 0 1 10
If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly .	39 6 0 1 16 20 21 1 2 6 0 1 4 79 35 10
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like .	6 1 11 6 36 0 0 0 1 18 19 1 13 0 1 33 11 1 23 4 35 19 10
That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .	23 44 6 1 13 52 1 72 16 4 154 18 19 0 0 1 38 1 91 1 4 19 6 1 10
Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric .	0 0 0 1 13 6 1 4 168 207 66 6 1 11 52 6 1 13 0 1 38 0 1 12 1 42 1 35 30 52 6 1 12 0 2 0 1 4 79 38 6 1 10
Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves .	76 105 6 1 42 1 11 35 35 6 1 12 23 10
George Bush , for example , may decide that he does n't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California .	0 1 2 85 1 2 4 77 66 23 4 35 154 18 19 6 1 33 73 1 12 0 1 7 6 0 1 12 1 10
And some other segments of California 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .	76 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 13 0 1 4 35 154 18 77 35 66 6 1 4 5 0 1 7 6 1 42 36 0 1 38 6 1 12 0 0 1 13 0 1 10
This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it .	6 0 1 4 344 1 5 23 38 6 1 161 7 6 1 16 22 7 0 13 0 1 2 13 7 1 182 22 309 55 6 0 1 64 18 19 23 10
First , there was a death watch .	76 2 50 51 6 0 1 10
Then exhilaration .	52 1 10
Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 .	40 38 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 34 35 13 11 52 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 2 32 1 38 1 10
It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash .	23 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 12 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders .	39 6 1 11 1 33 44 6 0 1 4 79 35 2 23 11 35 6 0 1 40 38 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 10
A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge .	6 0 1 75 0 1 12 6 0 1 11 1 2 35 459 35 2 13 6 0 1 33 11 0 0 1 11 1 12 1 42 0 0 0 1 10

Meanwhile , in a divergence in two of the market 's most important indicators , the Dow industrials ' sister average , the 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second-worst decline next to the 164.78-point fall during the 1987 crash .	76 2 59 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 42 36 0 1 2 6 0 1 42 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 0 1 2 34 35 38 1 38 6 0 1 24 84 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon .	1 48 7 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 1 13 1 2 33 16 11 24 25 0 1 30 23 34 38 1 35 57 182 40 67 35 10
UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday 's 190.58-point market plunge , fell 56 7\/8 to 222 7\/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares .	1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 2 34 67 35 38 0 1 38 36 36 0 1 10
Overall , this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , said Arthur Cashin Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board .	76 2 23 11 6 0 1 13 23 28 29 24 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory .	23 28 149 1 53 7 6 0 1 217 6 1 13 1 217 6 0 1 18 87 7 0 1 10
It 's just a strange feeling .	23 11 52 6 0 1 10
I do n't think anyone left the place whistling Dixie .	23 368 35 44 23 11 6 1 32 1 10
The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre-trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was an abnormal condition , and not a disaster .	6 1 73 1 2 1255 148 7 1 2 7 6 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 75 1 42 0 1 11 6 0 1 2 13 52 6 1 10
But to traders , it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell .	76 59 1 2 23 48 7 1 38 6 0 0 0 1 10
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30 .	6 0 0 0 1 28 126 1 67 38 1 10
But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday 's late-afternoon rout .	76 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 2 12 0 1 13 0 1 2 4 35 79 70 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 22 35 7 1 42 0 1 10

The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .	6 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 2 13 59 0 1 23 34 203 293 1 14 22 7 52 6 0 1 10
More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood .	0 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 2 30 6 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 93 327 6 1 24 34 18 19 0 1 12 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses .	76 2 18 178 1 24 2 0 0 1 34 35 2 111 1 7 0 1 10
There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets .	50 51 0 0 1 2 30 1 11 0 1 12 1 13 11 0 1 18 87 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10

The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized .	6 1 12 6 0 1 11 6 80 66 23 12 6 0 0 0 1 4 79 35 30 6 1 34 10
They did n't .	23 34 35 10
The Dow accelerated its slide , losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading .	6 1 11 6 1 2 32 1 38 6 0 0 1 12 1 10
With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .	352 0 1 161 7 1 2 1 48 35 7 6 1 13 282 1 79 10
Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall .	76 59 1 6 1 16 64 18 79 2 13 39 23 34 35 23 28 24 67 35 68 6 0 1 10
And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible .	76 103 1 2 23 11 35 52 6 0 1 33 28 24 10
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .	52 6 1 20 139 1 7 52 0 1 75 0 0 1 13 0 0 0 1 37 32 1 35 10
The program traders were in there , too , of course .	6 0 1 48 7 1 2 35 2 38 1 10
But according to one trader , the programmers did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of bargain-hunting by institutions .	76 122 7 0 1 2 6 1 4 35 115 29 53 84 6 1 161 7 6 1 30 50 51 166 35 167 6 1 12 1 12 1 10

Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes .	1 12 0 0 1 78 11 1 42 1 10
According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day .	122 7 0 0 1 2 1 11 1 12 6 0 0 1 38 1 91 23 11 1 12 6 0 1 33 4 35 19 1 81 1 10
The stock opened late at 114 1\/2 , down 8 1\/2 .	6 1 48 35 7 0 1 2 38 0 1 10
But then it shot upward 7 1\/2 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said .	76 76 23 34 38 0 1 30 0 2 0 0 1 28 24 13 34 2 1 27 10
However , Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said : I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume .	76 2 0 0 0 1 44 106 23 4 74 40 30 1 11 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's gridlock .	59 0 1 2 0 1 14 351 66 23 4 460 148 19 6 1 35 2 38 1 12 1 42 1 10

It was orderly .	23 28 24 10

There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... .	50 51 35 6 1 12 0 1 2 67 35 13 35 106 10
Not like Friday where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart .	161 7 1 75 23 16 136 166 6 1 167 24 10
Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were glum .	76 2 6 1 20 35 35 169 7 0 1 2 13 1 28 24 10
But in another dramatic burst , the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes , and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74 .	76 59 6 0 1 2 6 1 48 7 0 1 38 0 1 2 13 59 1 6 1 11 6 1 12 1 10

The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday .	6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 28 24 30 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 14 40 35 10

They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , said one Chicago-based options trader .	23 14 16 40 2 40 2 56 0 0 0 1 10
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose 20 stocks mimic the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally .	6 1 65 66 6 36 0 0 0 1 2 135 0 1 11 6 0 1 2 4 35 19 1 42 0 1 10
James Gallagher , a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau , said , The difference between today and two years ago -- Terrible Tuesday , Oct. 20 , 1987 -- is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million and get the program rally started .	0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 44 2 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 123 12 0 1 2 340 9 2 250 106 65 66 76 23 82 6 1 18 79 38 6 0 0 1 2 19 86 0 9 13 555 6 0 1 40 10

Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a vengeance .	76 39 6 1 48 7 6 0 1 18 79 2 23 28 24 38 6 1 10
However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday .	76 2 122 7 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 72 85 6 1 28 53 7 23 12 0 1 10

Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's late-afternoon chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them .	39 6 0 1 42 0 1 48 7 6 36 0 0 1 2 6 1 16 28 24 213 7 1 42 0 1 2 70 7 1 13 1 33 48 7 23 10

But yesterday , even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck , we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- and it was n't too bad , said Donaldson 's Mr. Eppel , who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday .	76 76 2 137 59 1 12 52 0 0 1 12 1 2 23 11 166 6 1 167 13 23 28 35 29 24 2 56 1 42 0 1 2 33 20 164 53 7 6 1 42 1 12 1 10
According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and Valero Energy .	122 7 6 0 0 1 2 39 0 1 34 35 2 50 51 0 0 1 38 36 0 1 12 1 2 1 13 0 1 10

Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. 9 through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks .	76 58 6 0 1 42 1 12 86 9 59 1 42 1 2 0 0 1 20 151 40 35 38 1 2 1 2 0 1 13 0 0 1 10

Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months .	0 1 65 66 0 0 1 28 35 53 155 32 1 42 1 38 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were program-related , he said .	0 0 1 12 6 24 25 36 0 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 12 1 42 1 2 75 6 1 12 0 1 14 40 2 28 24 2 23 27 10
Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , Mr. Phelan said .	0 1 11 35 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 38 6 0 1 2 13 59 6 0 1 2 23 11 35 35 23 23 4 630 11 6 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday .	0 1 11 80 66 6 1 34 35 10
Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it 's going to make everybody nervous , including me , he said .	76 2 103 1 23 11 6 1 12 1 2 23 37 113 18 178 23 24 2 38 23 2 23 27 10

Meanwhile , Peter DaPuzzo , Shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors .	76 2 0 1 2 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 2 11 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 33 11 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 0 1 35 38 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 10

It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19 .	23 11 6 1 12 118 34 38 86 9 10
They used their judgment .	23 11 6 1 10
They did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning .	23 4 35 79 38 6 0 1 12 1 81 1 10
Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly .	76 2 23 48 7 1 13 48 7 6 1 2 90 136 6 1 24 10
Maybe they learned from experience .	76 23 48 7 1 10
Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close .	0 1 44 6 1 12 1 12 1 42 1 28 24 2 30 122 7 0 0 0 0 1 40 38 6 1 0 1 14 40 13 14 35 40 38 6 1 10

A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii .	6 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 12 6 1 12 0 1 69 78 12 1 13 1 10
The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less .	6 1 4 19 23 12 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 13 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 69 78 10
The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years .	6 1 40 38 0 1 12 1 13 1 64 18 19 52 6 0 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 2 33 20 170 23 29 24 38 6 1 12 0 1 38 0 1 10
By a 6-4 margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights .	59 6 0 1 2 0 1 16 11 67 35 6 0 1 32 6 0 1 10
But the six-hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions .	76 6 0 1 14 35 172 7 38 0 1 10
As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast .	59 6 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 4 74 40 30 23 48 7 6 0 1 2 13 6 1 4 19 0 1 120 2 38 1 2 38 1 13 38 6 0 1 10
Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative .	59 6 1 2 6 1 20 21 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 2 33 20 195 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 18 19 1 12 6 1 10
The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with more than $ 205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver .	6 1 14 22 7 6 24 25 125 0 9 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 42 1 2 13 6 0 1 14 22 7 24 227 86 0 9 12 0 1 40 38 1 102 102 13 1 40 38 0 1 2 12 1 10

Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban .	0 0 0 1 73 6 0 1 7 0 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 1 2 13 6 0 1 82 6 1 12 6 1 18 5 6 1 7 6 0 1 10
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members .	39 6 0 1 20 21 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 70 7 6 1 12 0 1 13 6 36 0 2 13 36 0 2 1 12 1 10
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor .	59 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 16 11 6 1 12 1 40 38 1 12 1 2 1 13 1 33 20 169 7 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 10

One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore .	0 0 1 65 66 0 1 11 6 1 35 10
Typically , it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned .	76 2 23 4 74 40 38 6 1 12 1 13 4 134 6 1 69 78 18 74 40 13 40 10

But for photofinishers , developing costs for black-and-white film are higher .	76 59 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 28 24 10
Some companies are starting to tackle that problem .	6 1 37 113 18 19 6 1 10

But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad .	76 6 0 1 44 6 1 12 1 13 1 11 52 6 1 10

Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end .	6 0 1 12 1 12 1 20 195 6 1 18 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 67 38 1 42 1 10
But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , says Geoffrey H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility .	76 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 136 6 1 92 1 123 29 24 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 0 1 16 11 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 33 162 38 6 1 55 1 13 1 34 13 34 10
The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely .	6 1 16 34 67 30 6 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 28 24 10
No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks , Mr. Moore reports .	6 1 14 40 30 6 1 11 6 1 93 120 38 6 1 2 0 1 27 10
Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well .	22 35 7 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 15 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 11 36 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 1 13 0 1 69 78 10
They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation .	23 11 6 36 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 38 1 12 1 10
Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators .	32 6 1 438 6 1 42 0 1 18 19 1 13 1 2 30 6 1 4 79 2 38 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 10
Over the full post-World War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries .	59 6 0 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 85 6 1 2 20 21 0 1 67 35 68 6 1 12 1 13 60 35 67 35 68 1 10
The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries .	6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 135 1 11 6 0 1 2 28 29 24 38 0 1 12 1 13 36 0 1 12 1 10
The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression .	6 0 1 16 20 318 55 6 0 0 1 4 163 60 2 541 23 60 2 38 1 2 38 6 0 0 1 12 1 33 11 35 6 0 1 10
The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash .	6 1 11 6 1 38 1 123 13 16 34 35 70 7 13 38 6 1 10
It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , Mr. Moore says .	23 11 6 0 0 1 12 119 23 37 32 35 2 0 1 27 10
A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond-price index , which is not a part of the Commerce index .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 20 21 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 0 1 2 33 11 35 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 .	59 1 2 6 0 1 48 7 6 36 0 1 38 0 1 10
It also rose last Friday , while the stock market sagged .	23 16 34 67 35 2 30 6 0 1 34 10
Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new home-building permits .	0 1 12 6 0 0 1 11 6 1 12 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 22 7 1 2 13 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long-range prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns .	29 53 7 6 0 1 145 6 0 1 2 138 0 1 232 11 35 81 1 52 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 30 23 16 28 53 155 32 6 0 1 13 1 10
As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index .	137 122 7 1 2 6 0 1 106 196 40 38 6 36 36 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 106 14 22 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 7 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 33 16 11 35 6 0 1 10
It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components .	23 14 15 6 1 12 1 230 7 6 0 1 2 70 7 1 120 67 70 7 1 12 6 0 1 10
The stock market has lost some precursory power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments .	6 0 1 20 21 6 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 44 2 70 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital .	1 20 164 29 53 7 1 16 16 22 7 6 0 1 2 0 1 27 2 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 13 1 12 0 1 10
He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .	23 16 65 66 6 1 12 36 0 1 12 0 1 20 21 6 0 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 10
BSN S.A. , a leading French food group , said it agreed to acquire Birkel G.m.b . H. , a West German pasta maker .	0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 2 44 23 64 18 19 0 0 10 1 2 6 36 0 0 1 10
The value of the acquisition was n't disclosed .	6 1 12 6 1 14 35 40 10
The move is in line with BSN 's strategy of gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth .	6 1 48 7 1 12 1 42 1 93 16 32 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 38 0 1 10
BSN will initially acquire a 15 % interest in Birkel , a closely held concern .	1 4 16 19 6 36 0 1 12 1 2 6 36 0 1 10
The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding , and this could be completed within a few months , a BSN spokeswoman said .	6 0 1 11 6 1 146 23 6 1 18 19 52 6 1 24 2 13 23 4 74 40 38 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 27 10
The takeover was submitted for approval by the West German cartel office , BSN said .	6 1 14 22 7 1 38 6 36 0 0 1 2 1 27 10
Birkel is West Germany 's second-biggest producer of pasta , with sales of 250 million marks -LRB- $ 133.4 million -RRB- in 1988 .	1 11 0 1 42 0 1 12 1 2 38 1 12 36 0 1 12 86 0 9 167 12 1 10
It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany , and is that nation 's leading producer of pasta sauces .	23 11 0 1 38 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 13 11 6 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 10
The acquisition strengthens BSN 's position in the European pasta market .	6 1 11 1 42 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
The French group currently ranks second after Barilla Group of Italy , whose sales are chiefly in the Italian market .	6 0 1 16 28 53 7 0 1 12 1 2 135 1 48 35 7 6 0 1 10
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it reduced its rating on $ 281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company , to C from Ca , saying it believes bondholders will recover only negligible principal .	1 42 0 0 1 44 23 11 6 1 12 86 0 9 12 0 13 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 38 1 38 1 2 214 23 44 1 4 19 0 0 1 10

The rating agency said about $ 85 million in securities was affected .	6 0 1 44 0 86 0 9 12 1 14 40 10
The downgrades were prompted , Moody 's said , by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust 's preferred stock .	6 1 14 40 2 0 1 44 2 38 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 6 1 12 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
Moody 's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could , if completed , endanger the thrift 's funding and market position .	0 1 16 44 23 44 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 4 2 223 40 2 19 6 1 42 1 13 0 1 10

Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened .	1 34 67 38 6 0 1 2 120 35 38 1 12 6 0 210 1 2 13 120 35 2 30 6 0 1 34 10

For one thing , last Friday , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late-in-the-day nose dive , so it could n't react to it .	59 0 1 2 137 76 2 0 0 1 34 30 6 0 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 2 30 23 4 35 87 7 23 10
Back on Friday , Oct. 16 , l987 , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell .	122 7 1 2 86 9 2 123 2 6 0 1 34 38 6 1 2 13 0 1 34 30 6 0 1 34 10
The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ 8.70 to as high as $ 471.60 , and the more deferred positions , due to mature as late as March 1989 , rose as much as $ 9.60 .	6 0 0 1 188 1 34 667 24 7 86 9 38 366 24 7 86 9 2 13 6 0 0 1 2 43 18 79 67 70 7 1 123 2 34 667 24 7 86 9 10
On Black Monday , Oct. 19 , 1987 , the October contract tacked on further gains , rising to as high as $ 491.50 for a gain of almost $ 20 on top of the Friday advances , before giving up almost $ 10 of that at the close .	59 0 1 2 86 9 2 123 2 6 0 1 11 35 0 1 2 120 38 366 24 7 86 9 38 6 1 12 0 86 9 12 1 12 6 0 1 2 57 32 35 0 86 9 12 23 38 6 1 10

One analyst , Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co. , New York , said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market .	0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 69 78 2 44 6 0 1 16 11 6 0 0 0 1 33 4 163 195 1 18 79 2 38 13 38 6 0 1 10
What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , said Mr. Cardillo .	119 6 0 1 11 4 134 6 1 18 19 1 35 117 23 4 163 60 2 56 0 1 10
There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said .	50 51 6 0 80 66 1 4 19 6 1 13 79 35 2 23 27 10
He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising .	23 11 6 1 12 0 1 2 33 4 19 1 57 111 6 1 155 120 10
Finally , according to Mr. Cardillo , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released today .	76 2 122 7 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 4 74 22 7 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 30 6 1 14 40 35 10

Worried that Friday 's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices .	351 66 1 42 0 0 0 1 4 19 6 1 12 1 18 79 12 6 1 2 0 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ 20.59 a barrel for November delivery , down 30 cents .	6 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 48 7 86 9 92 1 12 0 1 2 38 0 1 10
Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow , following several days of significant gains .	6 1 44 1 28 53 7 6 1 35 2 38 0 1 12 0 1 10
But most market observers agreed that Friday 's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday .	76 0 0 1 65 66 1 42 0 0 1 11 118 11 1 12 6 0 1 35 10
Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong .	59 1 2 0 1 20 151 40 35 38 80 66 0 0 1 4 154 18 115 24 10

Indeed , after reacting early in the trading day to Friday 's plummet , futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday .	76 2 181 45 70 7 6 0 1 7 1 42 1 2 0 1 34 35 35 30 1 73 1 7 6 0 1 42 0 1 35 10

Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use .	1 28 24 38 6 1 12 1 38 80 66 6 1 12 6 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over , according to an analyst .	76 6 1 12 6 0 1 11 0 1 12 1 30 1 34 30 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 28 29 24 2 70 7 6 1 10

At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 , but it was n't able to sustain the gain .	59 0 1 12 0 1 2 39 6 0 1 34 2 6 0 1 34 38 366 24 7 86 9 2 13 23 28 35 43 18 19 6 1 10
It was simply overbought , he said , and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices .	23 28 35 24 2 23 44 2 13 1 12 1 33 28 29 24 4 19 1 10

Technical considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market Friday , caused prices to decline yesterday , said Ernest Simon , cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities , New York .	0 1 12 6 1 2 33 11 6 1 12 6 1 35 2 82 1 18 79 35 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 2 69 78 10

However , after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip late Friday , Mr. Simon said .	76 2 181 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 1 64 18 79 67 35 2 0 1 27 10
That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure , he said .	6 1 34 35 13 73 1 7 1 2 23 27 10

A price-depressing factor , one analyst said , was that India , which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market , did n't make any purchases .	6 0 1 2 0 1 44 2 65 66 1 2 33 20 151 17 18 19 36 0 1 12 1 38 6 0 1 2 4 35 19 6 1 10

India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , said Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .	1 4 163 174 66 39 50 51 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 23 11 1 2 23 4 87 7 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 2 69 78 10

The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which would hurt demand for beef and pork .	6 1 12 0 13 0 0 1 34 35 30 1 65 66 6 0 0 1 16 4 79 38 6 1 12 0 1 67 500 18 134 23 18 19 35 6 1 12 6 1 2 90 4 19 1 12 1 13 1 10

Herbert M.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38 , panic did n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday 's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity .	6 0 0 0 1 64 35 35 18 87 7 1 2 1 4 35 19 6 1 42 1 2 13 1 24 13 24 64 18 5 1 42 0 0 1 7 6 0 1 2 52 6 1 10

As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers .	39 1 34 67 35 38 6 0 1 2 1 12 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 4 35 79 38 1 30 6 1 12 0 1 37 32 1 10

Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in a few hours ' time must be expected .	1 24 13 24 44 23 11 0 1 38 6 0 1 104 59 6 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 13 1 12 6 0 1 42 1 4 74 40 10

Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback .	0 0 1 11 6 1 38 1 42 1 10
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day .	6 0 1 11 6 1 18 19 1 91 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 34 35 70 7 6 1 10

The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen , bounced back strongly to 141.8 , thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks .	6 1 2 211 120 35 38 0 1 38 0 1 2 28 24 35 38 1 2 16 32 80 66 1 4 19 0 1 10
And the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped calm investors .	76 6 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 75 6 1 48 35 7 1 16 4 19 1 10
Many major institutions , for example , came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday .	36 0 1 2 85 1 2 28 38 1 35 43 18 19 23 12 6 0 1 23 232 20 151 16 40 38 1 10
Still , amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's .	76 2 59 52 6 1 13 1 12 1 12 1 42 1 2 6 0 1 65 66 50 51 23 24 84 6 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 69 12 0 1 10
There is too much complacency , says money manager Barry Schrager .	50 51 36 0 1 2 56 0 0 0 1 10

So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start .	76 1 78 16 11 1 42 1 12 1 2 75 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 48 35 7 6 0 1 10

But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down 647 .	76 6 0 1 11 6 1 2 13 6 1 16 34 35 38 0 1 2 16 37 35 2 156 126 1 10

Chicago investor William Farley agreed to sell three divisions of Cluett Peabody & Co. for about $ 600 million to Bidermann S.A. , a closely held clothing maker based in Paris .	0 0 0 1 64 18 467 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 7 0 86 0 9 7 0 1 2 6 36 0 0 1 40 38 1 10
Shortly after completing the $ 1.56 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell Inc. in April , Mr. Farley 's holding company , Farley Inc. , said it was considering the sale of Cluett , a leading shirt maker and one of West Point-Pepperell 's biggest units .	137 181 32 6 125 0 9 1 12 0 0 1 38 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 2 0 1 2 44 23 37 32 6 1 12 1 2 6 0 0 1 13 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 10

They said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of November .	23 44 6 1 14 17 18 74 40 38 6 1 12 1 10
Mr. Farley said the sale of three of Cluett 's four main divisions plus other anticipated West Point-Pepperell asset sales by December , should bring in a total of about $ 700 million .	0 1 44 6 1 12 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 13 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 4 19 35 6 1 12 0 86 0 9 10

Britain 's Blue Arrow PLC intends to change its name to Manpower PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $ 1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of U.S.-based Manpower Inc .	1 42 0 0 1 64 18 5 6 1 7 0 1 13 19 35 6 1 12 6 0 86 0 9 12 0 1 22 7 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to reincorporating the world 's biggest employment-services group in the U.S. .	0 0 0 0 1 65 38 6 1 66 6 0 1 4 19 6 1 93 32 6 1 42 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
Mr. Fromstein disclosed the planned steps , expected within a few months , as Blue Arrow posted a 2.5 % drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings .	0 1 11 6 0 1 2 40 38 6 0 1 2 30 0 1 11 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
The name change and good will write-off could help solidify Blue Arrow 's dominance of the U.S. temporary-help market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday 's market plunge .	6 0 0 13 0 0 1 4 143 19 0 1 42 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 221 23 6 36 0 1 30 0 1 28 53 7 0 1 38 1 42 0 1 10
U.S. holders now own more than 60 % of Blue Arrow compared with 9 % last January .	0 1 16 11 24 25 0 1 12 0 1 70 7 0 0 0 1 10
In the U.S. market , the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow , Mr. Fromstein said .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 28 29 24 84 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
The moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil .	6 1 16 4 19 1 42 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 10
It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past , said Doug Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York .	23 16 11 6 80 66 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
The proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me , he added .	6 0 1 78 73 6 1 12 1 7 23 2 23 27 10
In a widely publicized boardroom coup , Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January , a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $ 1 million-a-year chief of Milwaukee-based Manpower .	59 6 36 0 0 1 2 0 1 73 0 1 7 0 0 0 1 38 1 2 6 1 177 0 1 20 1260 0 1 24 7 6 453 9 0 1 12 0 1 10
Mr. Fromstein solidified his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman .	0 1 11 6 1 38 1 57 45 35 7 0 1 38 1 10
But the Blue Arrow tumult is n't over yet , as the British government is investigating a disputed # 25 million -LRB- $ 39.4 million -RRB- loan which Mr. Fromstein has said was made under Mr. Berry 's direction .	76 6 0 0 1 28 35 24 35 2 30 6 0 1 37 32 6 0 125 0 9 526 527 0 9 167 1 138 0 1 20 871 14 40 38 0 1 42 1 10
Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $ 1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies .	0 1 28 43 18 19 35 6 125 0 9 1 12 1 38 1 67 30 0 0 13 0 0 1 73 0 0 1 7 0 1 10
Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase .	59 0 1 2 0 1 28 43 18 19 35 38 1 6 86 0 9 12 0 1 45 7 6 1 10
As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .	59 6 0 1 2 0 1 4 154 18 5 6 0 1 7 366 24 7 0 1 2 32 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets .	0 1 11 6 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 2 0 1 13 1 12 6 0 13 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards .	76 59 36 0 1 16 40 38 6 1 2 0 1 11 6 1 67 35 2 70 7 6 0 13 0 0 1 10
Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , Mr. Fromstein said .	6 0 1 48 273 23 34 38 1 42 1 2 0 1 27 10
The British version shows a handful of pounds of net worth following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the American version reflects $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written off .	6 0 1 11 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 30 6 0 1 11 86 0 9 12 0 1 30 0 1 12 166 6 0 1 167 20 151 40 35 10
Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop , but would n't specify how much .	0 1 44 23 64 18 19 23 12 6 0 1 40 38 0 1 42 0 1 38 0 0 1 2 13 4 35 19 6 1 10
People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower 's good will .	1 24 84 0 1 44 6 1 4 19 6 0 1 2 31 1 214 0 1 11 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
That move , along with the return to the Manpower name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help .	6 1 2 415 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 4 19 6 1 42 1 38 36 0 1 12 0 1 10
The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after sliding nearly 3.5 % in July , said Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur .	6 1 12 0 0 1 34 96 67 35 38 6 0 1 120 8 9 2 57 120 96 67 35 38 1 2 56 0 1 42 0 1 10
Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain .	0 1 73 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 40 8 9 35 7 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 10
Overall , pretax profit slid to # 18.49 million in the quarter from # 18.98 million a year earlier .	76 2 0 1 34 38 86 0 9 68 6 1 38 86 0 9 6 1 353 10
Richard G. Sim , the man credited with transforming Applied Power Inc. from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools , hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition , Barry Wright Corp .	0 0 1 2 6 1 22 155 311 0 0 1 7 6 1 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 64 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 0 0 1 10
The 45-year-old former General Electric Co. executive figures it will be easier this time .	6 0 0 0 0 0 1 44 23 4 115 24 81 1 10

The Watertown , Mass. , company 's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped .	6 36 2 0 2 1 42 1 20 164 24 13 6 1 20 60 10
Last year 's earnings of $ 1.3 million , including $ 815,000 from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million .	0 1 42 1 12 86 0 9 2 12 86 9 12 6 0 1 2 48 161 7 6 0 86 0 9 10
Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line .	181 32 0 1 42 1 2 33 11 86 0 9 38 1 2 0 1 4 19 6 0 13 0 1 10
The question is how long it 's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution , says F. John Mirek , an analyst at Blunt Ellis Loewi in Milwaukee .	6 1 162 376 1 23 37 113 18 639 0 1 18 19 6 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 10
The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim .	6 1 4 143 194 55 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 40 38 0 1 10
The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 , and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 .	6 36 2 0 2 1 239 24 7 86 9 92 1 38 1 123 2 13 0 1 42 1 16 11 6 453 9 0 1 38 1 10
Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988 .	0 0 1 4 19 6 1 67 70 7 1 2 38 1 123 10
The stock has since softened , trading around $ 25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $ 23.00 in national over-the-counter trading .	6 1 20 35 60 2 32 0 86 9 92 1 67 35 13 45 35 7 86 9 12 0 0 1 10
But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of	76 0 1 20 21 6 0 1 12 86 9 92 1 38 6 1 78
Reaching that goal , says Robert T. Foote , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require efficient reinvestment of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital .	32 6 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 42 0 0 1 2 4 19 0 1 12 1 12 1 13 1 12 6 0 36 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 10
In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation very similar to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 .	59 0 1 2 0 1 11 6 1 29 24 84 6 1 23 11 30 23 73 1 7 1 13 0 0 1 38 1 10
Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family .	1 2 69 92 36 0 1 2 37 120 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
While profitable , it was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , he says .	109 24 2 23 37 35 120 13 37 35 32 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 23 27 10
Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied .	0 1 28 266 66 6 1 18 19 0 0 1 4 79 38 0 1 30 23 34 38 1 10
He also professes an evangelical fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared .	23 16 11 6 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 33 11 1 33 34 13 75 1 14 40 10
Mr. Sim considers the new unit 's operations fundamentally sound and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors .	0 1 136 6 0 1 42 1 29 24 13 65 66 0 1 20 164 29 53 155 120 38 1 33 20 35 21 0 1 10
With a little patience , these businesses will perform very satisfactorily , Mr. Sim says .	59 905 1 23 2 6 1 4 79 67 35 2 0 1 27 10
Within about six months , things will be moving in the right direction , he predicts .	59 36 0 1 2 1 4 168 120 38 6 0 1 2 23 27 10

When he came to Applied , I did n't have the power to execute as I do today , he says .	39 23 34 38 1 2 23 4 35 19 6 1 18 79 30 23 34 35 2 23 27 10
He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November .	23 14 15 0 0 1 12 1 38 1 13 15 1 67 35 10
At Applied , Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective .	59 1 2 0 1 73 1 7 6 0 1 10
He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company 's acquisition program .	23 136 6 1 24 38 6 1 33 108 1 0 86 0 9 2 33 4 19 6 1 42 0 1 10

The company expects that earnings , which have marched steadily upward in recent years , reached about $ 20.8 million , or $ 1.58 a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ 15.2 million in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million in 1985 .	6 1 65 66 1 2 33 20 60 35 35 38 0 1 2 11 0 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 2 38 6 0 1 16 40 2 70 7 86 0 9 212 0 1 13 86 0 9 212 1 10

But while the New York Stock Exchange did n't fall apart Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos .	76 39 6 0 0 0 1 4 35 115 24 35 30 6 0 0 0 1 34 67 35 68 1 12 23 12 6 0 1 106 23 16 64 18 19 6 1 12 1 10

Then in a lightning plunge , the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year , chalking up a 190.58-point , or 6.9 % , loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume .	76 59 6 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 85 52 6 1 11 52 6 1 12 6 1 92 1 2 32 35 6 0 2 13 36 0 2 1 12 6 1 38 0 0 1 10
Final-hour trading accelerated to 108.1 million shares , a record for the Big Board .	0 1 34 38 36 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
At the end of the day , 251.2 million shares were traded .	59 6 1 12 6 1 2 36 0 1 14 40 10
The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2569.26 .	6 0 0 1 48 7 1 10
The Dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the 508-point Black Monday crash that occurred Oct. 19 , 1987 .	6 1 42 1 28 365 7 0 1 161 7 6 0 0 0 1 33 34 8 9 2 208 10
In percentage terms , however , the Dow 's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83 , or 8 % , a week after Black Monday .	59 0 1 2 76 2 6 1 42 1 11 6 1 78 13 6 1 75 6 1 34 35 2 13 67 35 2 6 1 209 0 1 10
The Dow fell 22.6 % on Black Monday .	6 1 34 67 35 38 0 1 10
Shares of UAL , the parent of United Airlines , were extremely active all day Friday , reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ 6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group .	1 12 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 2 28 29 24 81 1 35 2 45 7 1 13 1 12 6 0 125 0 9 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Wall Street 's takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and UAL stock would rise .	0 1 42 0 1 2 13 0 1 2 20 21 36 0 80 66 6 1 4 79 13 0 1 4 79 10
At 2:43 p.m. EDT , came the sickening news : The Big Board was halting trading in UAL , pending news .	59 0 0 1 2 242 6 0 1 104 6 0 1 37 32 1 12 1 2 38 1 10
On the exchange floor , as soon as UAL stopped trading , we braced for a panic , said one top floor trader .	59 6 0 1 2 137 76 694 1 37 120 2 23 48 7 6 1 2 56 0 0 0 1 10
Several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed .	0 1 4 74 763 32 6 1 30 6 1 34 10
For weeks , the market had been nervous about takeovers , after Campeau Corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers .	59 1 2 6 1 20 164 53 7 1 2 30 0 1 42 0 1 11 1 12 6 1 12 0 36 0 1 10
And 10 minutes after the UAL trading halt came news that the UAL group could n't get financing for its bid .	76 0 1 567 6 0 0 1 242 80 66 6 0 1 4 35 19 1 12 6 1 10
At this point , the Dow was down about 35 points .	59 6 1 2 6 1 28 126 36 0 1 10
The market crumbled .	6 1 34 10
Arbitragers could n't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had .	1 4 35 19 6 0 1 106 13 23 73 23 7 36 0 0 1 23 11 10
For example , their selling caused trading halts to be declared in USAir Group , which closed down 3 7\/8 to 41 1\/2 , Delta Air Lines , which fell 7 3\/4 to 69 1\/4 , and Philips Industries , which sank 3 to 21 1\/2 .	59 1 2 6 1 82 0 1 18 74 40 38 0 1 2 33 28 179 0 1 7 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 33 34 67 35 38 0 1 2 13 0 1 2 33 34 35 38 0 1 10
These stocks eventually reopened .	6 1 16 34 10
But as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses .	76 39 1 34 2 1 64 18 19 0 1 69 12 0 1 13 0 0 1 18 19 6 1 10
When trading was halted in Philip Morris , the stock was trading at 41 , down 3 3\/8 , while IBM closed 5 5\/8 lower at 102 .	39 1 14 40 38 0 1 2 6 1 37 45 7 1 2 38 0 1 2 30 1 48 0 1 26 7 1 10
Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic stop-loss orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels .	1 34 70 7 1 12 0 0 1 2 33 14 40 38 1 30 1 34 38 0 1 10
Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals , including computer-guided program traders .	1 12 6 0 0 1 34 38 0 0 1 2 12 0 0 1 10
Traders said most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight .	1 44 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 85 6 0 1 2 34 35 10
Now , at 3:07 , one of the market 's post-crash reforms took hold as the S&P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials .	76 2 59 1 2 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 11 1 30 6 0 0 0 1 20 60 67 35 2 24 84 52 52 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , trading was temporarily halted in Chicago .	59 6 1 40 38 6 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 2 1 14 35 40 38 1 10
After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board , and specialists continued to notch prices down .	59 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 12 1 64 18 19 1 78 38 6 0 1 2 13 1 64 18 19 1 35 10
As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart .	59 6 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 13 0 1 28 24 10
Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board .	59 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 54 55 1 44 6 0 0 1 14 40 106 0 1 28 43 18 19 0 1 40 38 6 0 1 10
The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders .	6 0 1 14 35 40 38 0 0 0 1 10
It screwed things up , said one major specialist .	23 11 1 35 2 56 0 0 1 10
This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings .	6 1 16 11 0 1 12 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 33 16 11 6 0 13 0 1 2 13 20 151 22 38 23 7 6 1 42 0 1 10
-LRB- In a stock-index arbitrage sell program , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference . -RRB-	166 59 6 0 0 0 1 2 1 11 13 11 0 1 12 1 13 11 6 1 12 1 18 19 35 6 0 1 10 167
When the airline information came through , it cracked every model we had for the marketplace , said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms .	39 6 0 1 34 35 2 23 11 6 1 23 11 12 6 1 2 56 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
We did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do .	23 4 35 35 19 6 1 18 19 6 1 23 64 18 19 10
But stocks kept falling .	76 1 37 120 10
The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt .	6 0 1 28 126 0 1 38 1 123 38 6 0 1 10
At 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the cooling off period , the average was down 114.76 points .	59 1 123 2 59 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 28 126 0 1 10
Meanwhile , during the the S&P trading halt , S&P futures sell orders began piling up , while stocks in New York kept falling sharply .	76 2 59 52 6 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 37 120 35 2 30 1 12 0 1 37 120 35 10
Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well mechanically .	0 0 0 0 0 1 44 35 6 0 1 34 35 35 10
I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things .	23 16 44 192 193 24 38 6 1 18 79 38 6 1261 293 0 1 4 163 21 13 21 1 10
Under another post-crash system , Big Board President Richard Grasso -LRB- Mr. Phelan was flying to Bangkok as the market was falling -RRB- was talking on an inter-exchange hot line to the other exchanges , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board .	59 6 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 337 0 1 37 120 38 1 30 6 1 37 120 167 37 120 38 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 13 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 10
He camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board , where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders .	23 34 35 38 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 75 23 4 19 1 12 1 13 0 0 1 10
At about 3:30 p.m. EDT , S&P futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line .	59 36 0 0 1 2 0 1 37 120 2 13 59 6 0 1 6 0 13 0 1 64 18 79 70 7 1 10
Buyers stepped in to the futures pit .	1 34 70 7 6 0 1 10
But the build-up of S&P futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again .	76 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 48 7 6 1 2 13 6 1 12 1 64 18 79 35 10
At about 3:45 , the S&P market careened to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again .	59 0 1 2 6 0 1 34 38 36 0 1 2 12 0 1 78 2 13 1 14 40 35 10
Futures traders say the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points .	0 1 44 6 1 37 207 66 6 1 4 79 67 35 68 0 1 10
During this time , small investors began ringing their brokers , wondering whether another crash had begun .	59 6 1 2 0 1 37 32 6 1 2 427 55 6 1 20 60 10
At Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , which is trying to cater to small investors , some demoralized brokers thought this would be the final confidence-crusher .	59 0 0 1 2 33 37 113 18 87 7 0 1 2 6 0 1 44 23 4 19 6 0 1 10
That 's when George L. Ball , chairman of the Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit , took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only mechanical .	23 162 55 0 0 1 2 1 12 6 36 36 0 71 1 1 2 48 7 6 0 0 1 18 77 66 6 1 28 29 24 10
I have a hunch that this particular decline today is something more ado about less .	23 11 6 80 66 6 0 1 78 11 23 69 78 112 1 10
It would be my inclination to advise clients not to sell , to look for an opportunity to buy , Mr. Ball told the brokers .	192 283 134 6 1 18 134 1 16 18 79 2 18 87 7 6 1 18 79 2 0 1 381 6 1 10
At Merrill Lynch & Co. , the nation 's biggest brokerage firm , a news release was prepared headlined Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop .	59 0 0 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 14 40 330 0 1 48 7 0 1 10
The release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987 and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market .	6 1 65 66 50 51 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 23 12 1 123 13 66 50 51 35 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
However , Jeffrey B. Lane , president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , said that Friday 's plunge is going to set back relations with customers , because it reinforces the concern of volatility .	76 2 0 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 65 66 1 42 1 37 113 18 19 35 1 12 1 2 30 23 11 6 1 12 1 10
And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading .	76 23 44 6 1 12 1 4 87 7 0 1 10
It 's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront .	23 37 113 18 19 6 1 67 70 7 6 1 10
As the Dow average ground to its final 190.58 loss Friday , the S&P pit stayed locked at its 30-point trading limit .	39 6 0 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 35 2 6 0 1 28 53 7 6 0 0 1 10
Jeffrey Yass of program trader Susquehanna Investment Group said 2,000 S&P contracts were for sale on the close , the equivalent of $ 330 million in stock .	0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 44 0 0 1 48 7 1 38 6 1 2 6 1 12 86 0 9 12 1 10
But there were no buyers .	76 50 51 6 1 10
While Friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning , traders said .	703 1 42 1 19 35 0 1 69 12 1 2 23 136 6 1 53 7 0 1 81 1 2 1 27 10
Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself .	0 0 1 48 7 36 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 78 10
At those levels , stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks .	59 6 1 2 1 14 17 35 18 74 40 38 0 1 2 33 11 35 1 57 32 1 30 0 1 34 2 13 16 11 35 1 10
But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today .	76 23 162 12 848 1 6 1 13 1 4 79 35 10
The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation .	6 1 12 6 0 13 0 1 78 4 35 19 0 1 54 55 0 1 28 29 53 7 6 0 1 10
The Big Board 's Mr. Grasso said , Our systemic performance was good .	6 0 1 42 0 1 44 2 6 0 1 28 24 10
But the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks .	76 6 1 4 87 7 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 10
Obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer-community obligations were n't met , he said .	76 23 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 124 23 44 6 0 1 14 35 40 2 23 27 10

But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash , the upstairs firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday 's blood-letting .	76 1 65 35 66 137 1103 59 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 33 11 6 1 57 32 0 1 12 1 106 34 38 6 1 38 1 42 1 10

Mr. Herscu proceeded to launch an ambitious , but ill-fated , $ 1 billion acquisition binge that included Bonwit Teller and B.

As small investors peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend , big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals : cash .	39 0 1 73 6 0 1 7 0 1 38 6 1 2 0 0 1 44 23 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 1 10
Unlike the weekend before Black Monday , the funds were n't swamped with heavy withdrawal requests .	59 6 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 14 35 22 7 0 0 1 10
And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week .	76 0 0 1 20 21 35 0 1 13 44 23 4 168 32 1 81 1 10
At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987 .	59 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 0 1 28 29 24 2 13 23 48 35 7 62 52 6 1 12 6 1 32 0 1 12 1 10

As of yesterday afternoon , the redemptions represented less than 15 % of the total cash position of about $ 2 billion of Fidelity 's stock funds .	122 7 0 1 2 6 1 11 24 25 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 86 0 9 12 1 42 0 1 10

People are n't panicking .	1 37 35 120 10
The test may come today .	6 1 4 79 35 10
Friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act .	1 42 0 0 1 34 67 728 198 0 1 18 79 10
Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices .	6 1 20 60 35 38 1 30 6 0 1 40 38 1 42 1 4 19 1 38 1 42 0 1 10
Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle did n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday .	0 0 1 85 6 0 1 4 35 154 18 79 409 346 6 1 34 38 0 1 10
But fund managers say they 're ready .	76 0 1 44 23 28 24 10
Many have raised cash levels , which act as a buffer against steep market declines .	1 20 21 0 1 2 33 48 7 6 1 38 0 0 1 10
Mario Gabelli , for instance , holds cash positions well above 20 % in several of his funds .	0 1 2 85 1 2 11 0 1 69 12 0 1 38 1 12 6 1 10
Windsor Fund 's John Neff and Mutual Series ' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20 % and 30 % , respectively , this year .	0 1 42 0 1 13 0 1 42 0 1 44 23 20 21 6 0 1 38 24 227 0 1 13 0 1 2 123 2 6 1 10
Even Peter Lynch , manager of Fidelity 's $ 12.7 billion Magellan Fund , the nation 's largest stock fund , built up cash to 7 % or $ 850 million .	0 0 1 2 1 12 1 42 125 0 9 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 11 35 1 38 0 1 13 86 0 9 10
One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions , the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September .	0 1 65 66 59 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 1 11 0 1 12 1 12 1 38 1 13 1 10
I 've let the money build up , Mr. Lynch said , who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes .	23 20 371 6 1 79 35 2 0 1 27 2 268 65 66 23 20 345 1 32 1 23 11 10
Not all funds have raised cash levels , of course .	36 0 1 20 21 0 1 2 38 1 10
As a group , stock funds held 10.2 % of assets in cash as of August , the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute .	59 6 1 2 0 1 73 0 1 12 1 7 1 70 7 1 2 6 0 1 24 84 6 0 0 1 10
That was modestly higher than the 8.8 % and 9.2 % levels in August and September of 1987 .	23 28 29 24 84 6 36 0 13 0 210 1 12 1 13 1 12 1 10
Also , persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash .	76 2 0 1 4 134 6 0 1 18 19 1 18 19 1 10
But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said .	76 6 0 1 12 0 1 28 116 29 24 81 1 208 2 0 1 27 10
A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday .	6 0 1 65 66 1 16 20 16 21 35 6 1 12 0 1 38 0 1 10
Stock-fund sales have rebounded in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels .	0 1 20 60 38 0 1 2 13 0 0 1 37 35 45 7 24 41 6 0 1 10

Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday would n't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas .	0 1 44 1 308 0 1 66 6 1 23 14 17 18 19 81 1 4 35 74 40 38 86 9 12 6 1 75 6 1 20 121 113 18 19 1 12 1 38 0 0 1 2 12 0 1 12 1 13 0 1 12 0 1 10
Now , those routes are n't expected to begin until Jan .	76 2 6 1 14 35 17 18 79 38 1 10
Boeing is also supposed to send to America West another 757 twin-engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year 's end .	1 14 35 17 18 19 38 0 1 6 0 0 1 102 102 13 6 1 38 1 42 1 10
Those , too , are almost certain to arrive late .	23 2 16 2 28 29 43 18 79 35 10
At this point , no other America West flights -- including its new service at San Antonio , Texas ; Newark , N.J. ; and Palmdale , Calif. -- have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries .	59 6 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 106 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 1 91 1 2 1 91 13 1 2 1 106 20 151 40 38 6 1 12 1 78 10
Nevertheless , the company 's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy .	76 2 6 1 42 1 11 6 0 1 138 6 0 1 69 12 1 4 19 12 0 1 12 6 1 10
It also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company .	23 16 28 43 18 344 6 1 5 0 1 7 6 1 10
I just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout , Tom Baker , president of Machinists ' District 751 , said in an interview yesterday .	23 16 4 35 77 66 6 1 4 35 19 13 4 19 6 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 12 1 42 1 123 2 27 153 6 1 185 10
I do n't think their customers would like it very much .	23 4 35 215 6 1 4 19 23 67 35 10
America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be .	0 1 2 16 2 11 6 0 1 13 29 29 53 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 47 1 12 6 1 4 79 10
I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets , they might not miss one at all , Mr. Otradovec said .	23 65 66 1 13 1 16 11 52 6 0 1 32 52 6 1 12 6 1 2 23 1035 250 19 1 38 23 2 0 1 27 10
Indeed , a random check Friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations .	76 2 6 0 0 1 4 35 154 18 77 66 6 1 37 32 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time .	0 1 11 6 0 1 24 84 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 13 64 18 19 6 1 38 1 10
It 's so close to completion , Boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem , said a Southwest spokesman .	23 28 157 53 7 1 2 1 20 649 23 50 190 35 19 6 1 2 56 6 0 1 10
A spokesman for AMR Corp. said Boeing has assured American Airlines it will deliver a 757 on time later this month .	6 1 12 0 1 44 1 20 649 0 1 23 4 19 6 1 38 1 67 81 1 10
American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable .	1 37 113 18 5 1 7 6 1 38 0 1 13 1 123 67 35 13 37 35 32 6 1 12 6 1 10
In Seattle , a Boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike .	59 1 2 6 0 1 65 66 6 1 20 169 7 0 1 12 23 12 6 1 13 66 192 193 24 18 19 456 0 1 4 74 40 38 6 1 10
Meanwhile , supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company 's Everett , Wash. , plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout .	76 2 1 13 0 1 20 121 113 18 19 36 0 1 12 0 0 13 0 0 1 12 6 1 42 36 2 0 2 1 106 33 14 72 16 40 38 6 1 10
As of Friday , four had been delivered and a fifth plane , a 747-400 , was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China .	122 7 1 2 1 20 151 40 13 6 0 1 2 6 1 2 14 17 18 74 40 35 38 6 1 38 0 1 10
No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table .	6 1 20 35 151 40 18 115 53 7 6 0 1 10
We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back , said Doug Hammond , the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began .	23 64 18 538 24 23 11 119 23 11 30 23 34 35 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 33 20 169 7 1 12 6 1 30 6 1 34 10
The investment community , for one , has been anticipating a speedy resolution .	6 0 1 2 85 1 2 20 121 32 6 0 1 10
Though Boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday , it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders .	39 1 42 0 1 14 40 70 7 6 1 12 6 1 35 2 23 16 20 60 38 6 0 0 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 10
The market has taken two views : that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term , said Howard Rubel , an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc .	6 1 20 21 0 1 106 75 6 0 1 4 74 40 38 6 0 1 13 75 1 28 29 24 38 1 38 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
Boeing 's shares fell $ 4 Friday to close at $ 57.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .	1 42 1 64 8 9 35 18 87 7 86 9 38 0 1 38 6 0 0 0 1 10
But Mr. Baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month , hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week .	76 0 1 44 23 44 6 1 6 1 4 74 40 4 19 6 1 12 6 1 2 207 66 6 1 13 1 4 19 1 67 70 7 6 1 10
Still , he said , it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer .	76 2 23 44 2 192 383 24 66 6 1 4 79 67 35 10
I would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything .	23 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 23 10
Last week , Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz sent striking workers a letter , saying that to my knowledge , Boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major U.S. industrial firm in recent history .	137 76 2 0 0 0 1 108 0 1 6 1 2 207 66 59 6 1 2 1 42 1 11 6 0 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
But Mr. Baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- very weak .	76 0 1 136 6 1 106 13 6 1 42 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 13 1 106 29 24 10
He added that the company miscalculated the union 's resolve and the workers ' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime .	23 65 66 6 1 11 6 1 42 1 13 6 1 42 1 93 182 17 18 19 0 1 35 10
In separate developments : -- Talks have broken off between Machinists representatives at Lockheed Corp. and the Calabasas , Calif. , aerospace company .	59 0 1 106 106 1 20 60 35 38 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 36 2 0 2 0 1 10
The union is continuing to work through its expired contract , however .	6 1 37 113 18 87 7 6 0 1 2 35 10
It had planned a strike vote for next Sunday , but that has been pushed back indefinitely .	23 20 21 6 0 1 38 0 1 2 13 23 20 151 40 35 35 10
-- United Auto Workers Local 1069 , which represents 3,000 workers at Boeing 's helicopter unit in Delaware County , Pa. , said it agreed to extend its contract on a day-by-day basis , with a 10-day notification to cancel , while it continues bargaining .	106 0 0 0 0 1 2 33 11 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 2 1 2 44 23 64 18 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 2 12 6 0 1 18 79 2 30 23 37 120 10
The accord expired yesterday .	6 1 34 35 10
-- And Boeing on Friday said it received an order from Martinair Holland for four model 767-300 wide-body jetliners valued at a total of about $ 326 million .	106 76 1 85 1 44 23 11 6 1 38 0 1 38 0 0 0 0 1 22 7 6 1 12 0 86 0 9 10
The planes , long range versions of the medium-haul twin-jet , will be delivered with Pratt & Whitney PW4060 engines .	6 1 2 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 4 74 40 38 0 0 0 0 1 10

A Boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out for a variety of reasons , but not because of the strike .	6 0 1 44 6 0 1 12 6 1 37 35 182 40 35 38 6 1 12 1 2 13 67 70 7 6 1 10

Atco Ltd. said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants , some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 851 million -RRB- , in Great Britain and elsewhere .	0 1 44 6 0 1 37 133 32 0 0 0 1 2 78 22 7 24 25 36 0 0 1 12 86 0 9 167 2 12 0 1 13 78 10
C.S. Richardson , Atco 's senior vice president , finance , said its 50.1%-owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada , and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere , including Britain , where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program .	0 1 2 1 42 0 0 1 2 1 2 44 6 0 0 0 0 1 37 32 0 1 12 0 1 2 13 0 0 0 0 1 230 2 7 1 2 75 6 0 1 64 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 38 1 12 6 0 1 10
The projects are big .	6 1 28 24 10
They can be C$ 1 billion plus , Mr. Richardson said .	23 4 19 86 0 9 123 2 0 1 27 10
But we would n't go into them alone , and Canadian Utilities ' equity stake would be small , he said .	76 23 4 35 79 38 23 35 2 13 0 1 42 0 1 4 115 24 2 23 27 10
Ideally , we 'd like to be the operator -LCB- of the project -RCB- and a modest equity investor .	76 2 23 4 154 18 19 6 1 166 12 6 1 167 13 6 0 0 1 10
Our long suit is our proven ability to operate power plants , he said .	6 0 1 11 6 0 1 18 19 0 1 2 23 27 10
Mr. Richardson would n't offer specifics regarding Atco 's proposed British project , but he said it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to privatize its massive water and electric utilities .	0 1 4 35 19 1 32 1 42 0 0 1 2 13 23 44 23 4 87 7 1 38 0 0 0 0 0 1 33 4 74 40 38 6 1 42 1 18 19 6 0 0 13 0 1 10
Britain 's government plans to raise about # 20 billion -LRB- $ 31.05 billion -RRB- from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities , beginning next month .	1 42 1 64 18 19 0 86 0 9 12 86 0 9 167 38 6 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 13 0 1 2 38 0 1 10

Under terms of the plan , independent generators would be able to compete for 15 % of customers until 1994 , and for another 10 % between 1994 and 1998 .	59 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 4 115 43 18 87 7 0 1 12 1 38 1 2 13 7 6 0 1 38 1 13 1 10

There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , Mr. Richardson said , and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it .	50 301 18 19 6 1 38 6 1 18 19 6 1 12 1 2 0 1 44 2 13 0 1 64 18 87 7 23 10
This is a real thrust on our utility side , he said , adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries , though he would be specific .	23 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 23 34 2 207 66 0 1 37 35 32 1 12 0 1 2 30 23 4 115 24 10

In the year-ago quarter , the designer and operator of cogeneration and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ 326,000 , or four cents a share , on revenue of about $ 41.4 million .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 13 1 12 0 13 0 0 0 1 11 0 1 12 86 9 2 13 0 1 92 1 2 38 1 12 0 86 0 9 10

The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals .	6 1 18 74 40 38 6 0 1 20 35 35 21 0 13 0 1 40 38 1 2 13 1 12 0 0 1 42 1 4 154 18 19 52 1 10
The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad .	6 1 11 6 80 66 23 4 35 19 6 1 12 1 2 13 59 1 2 23 4 19 1 38 0 102 13 0 1 2 90 4 87 7 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10

Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind .	76 2 1 11 1 2 13 76 39 23 11 6 0 1 2 23 11 23 2 56 0 1 2 207 66 23 44 6 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 10
We usually operate in that conservative manner .	23 16 34 38 6 0 1 10
By setting up the joint venture , Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , Mr. Karatz said .	181 32 35 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 4 19 6 36 0 1 93 32 0 1 2 57 32 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 0 1 27 10

When the price of plastics took off in 1987 , Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride .	39 6 1 12 1 34 35 38 1 2 0 0 1 28 24 38 6 1 10
The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer , John Hoyt Stookey , appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased Quantum 's reliance on plastics .	6 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 64 18 19 23 24 483 24 2 30 23 20 35 21 1 42 1 12 1 10
The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years .	6 1 11 1 12 6 0 1 30 0 1 34 35 38 0 1 10
Mr. Stookey said of the boom , It 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks .	0 1 48 7 6 1 2 23 310 113 18 79 6 0 1 26 117 23 34 10
But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum 's profit is plummeting .	76 76 1 20 60 13 1 42 1 37 120 10
Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a share , on sales of $ 724.4 million .	6 0 1 37 45 7 36 0 526 24 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 230 7 0 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 2 12 1 12 86 0 9 10
The stock , having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1 , closed at $ 34.375 share , down $ 1.125 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday .	6 1 2 315 21 52 6 1 12 6 1 38 86 9 2 48 7 86 9 78 2 38 86 9 2 38 0 0 0 0 0 1 35 10
To a degree , Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life .	59 6 1 2 1 11 6 0 1 33 20 60 12 1 12 6 0 0 1 33 11 0 1 10
Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices eroding .	315 35 60 38 1 12 6 36 0 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 16 235 6 1 120 10
Pricing cycles , to be sure , are nothing new for plastics producers .	0 1 2 18 115 24 2 11 23 24 38 0 1 10
And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them .	76 6 0 1 12 23 28 24 67 38 1 12 6 0 1 33 48 35 7 23 10
We were all wonderful heroes last year , says an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors .	23 11 35 0 1 67 35 2 56 6 1 12 1 12 1 42 1 10
Now we 're at the bottom of the heap .	76 23 48 7 6 1 12 6 1 10
At Quantum , which is based in New York , the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics .	59 1 2 33 14 40 38 0 1 2 6 1 14 40 38 6 1 42 0 1 12 1 10
Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in 1986 .	16 22 7 0 0 0 0 1 2 6 1 11 6 0 13 0 1 13 11 1 12 6 1 38 1 30 0 1 11 6 0 1 42 1 38 1 10
Mr. Stookey , 59 years old , declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction .	0 1 2 0 1 3 2 64 18 74 40 38 6 1 2 13 23 20 16 174 66 59 6 0 1 106 59 52 6 1 13 6 1 12 6 0 1 106 1 4 79 38 6 0 1 10
Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .	1 42 1 14 35 22 7 0 1 2 17 18 19 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 1 13 0 1 2 12 0 1 10
In the U.S. polyethylene market , Quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20 % .	59 6 0 0 1 2 1 20 21 6 0 1 2 36 0 1 10
But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co. , Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings .	76 6 1 106 12 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 106 11 36 0 0 1 13 16 14 16 40 38 0 1 10
When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound , Quantum 's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share , provided no other variables are changing .	39 6 1 12 1 11 6 0 1 92 1 2 1 42 0 1 34 38 36 0 1 92 1 2 30 6 0 1 37 120 10
In recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive .	59 0 1 6 1 12 1 2 72 16 487 23 12 0 0 1 2 20 21 6 1 10
Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents .	0 1 2 33 16 48 7 366 24 7 0 1 92 1 67 35 2 20 60 38 52 0 1 13 0 1 10
Meanwhile , the price of ethylene , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast .	76 2 6 1 12 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 20 35 60 67 67 35 10
That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs .	6 1 11 1 35 2 30 6 0 1 11 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year .	59 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 34 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them .	1 2 33 20 121 32 35 0 1 12 1 2 16 11 23 10
Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product .	207 66 0 1 4 35 168 45 7 6 1 2 0 1 16 65 66 1 20 60 13 16 64 18 19 35 1 102 13 19 0 1 10
Kenneth Mitchell , director of Dow 's polyethylene business , says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up .	0 1 2 1 12 1 42 0 1 2 44 1 14 17 18 194 336 24 1 20 60 38 6 0 1 30 1 34 35 10
People were even hoarding bags , he says .	1 37 35 32 1 2 23 27 10
Now producers hope prices have hit bottom .	76 1 44 1 20 21 1 10
They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks .	23 16 11 1 12 6 0 1 92 1 18 19 1 38 6 0 0 1 10
No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle .	6 1 162 2 35 2 55 6 0 0 1 4 79 30 1 13 1 64 18 79 10
One doubter is George Krug , a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks .	0 1 11 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 6 1 12 0 1 10
Noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , Some say October .	32 1 42 1 54 55 0 1 4 74 40 2 23 44 2 23 11 1 10
Some say November .	23 11 1 10
I say 1992 .	23 11 1 10
He argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity .	23 65 66 1 18 19 35 1 4 74 40 38 1 42 1 18 19 0 1 10
A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy .	6 0 1 28 53 7 1 30 6 0 1 28 24 10
The company is trying to carry out a three-year , $ 1.3 billion plant-expansion program started this year .	6 1 37 113 18 19 35 6 0 2 125 0 9 0 1 40 81 1 10
At the same time , its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ 240 million , largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ 50-a-share special dividend earlier this year .	59 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 24 141 79 140 6 1 3 38 0 86 0 9 2 67 70 7 1 40 35 18 19 6 125 9 0 1 67 81 1 10
Quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases .	1 73 6 1 38 6 1 7 6 1 100 23 18 19 6 1 38 6 1 2 30 6 0 1 37 35 32 6 0 0 1 10
Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation .	6 1 73 6 1 7 6 1 16 18 19 0 1 10
Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend , raised 36 % to 75 cents a share only a year ago , has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. Stookey deflected dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts .	55 6 0 1 4 35 134 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 2 40 67 35 38 0 1 92 1 52 6 1 26 2 1222 21 6 1 12 0 1 38 0 1 30 0 1 11 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 12 1 10
Some viewed his response -- that company directors review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more than the standard line from executives .	23 73 6 1 106 398 0 1 19 6 1 35 106 7 23 24 84 6 0 1 12 1 10
But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight-from-the-shoulder performance .	76 1 34 35 214 23 20 21 23 24 84 6 0 0 1 10
In any case , on the day of the meeting , Quantum 's shares slid $ 2.625 to $ 36.625 in Big Board trading .	59 6 1 2 59 6 1 12 6 1 2 1 42 1 34 8 9 38 86 9 38 0 0 1 10
On top of everything else , Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris , Ill .	59 1 12 23 24 2 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 1 10
After an explosion idled the plant in June , the company progressed in September to within 12 hours of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it .	39 6 1 11 6 1 38 1 2 6 1 34 38 1 70 36 0 1 494 32 6 0 1 93 32 23 10
Then a second explosion occurred .	76 6 0 1 34 10
Two workers died and six remain in the hospital .	0 1 34 13 1 48 7 6 1 10
This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes .	6 0 1 73 6 36 0 1 78 7 6 0 1 12 1 42 1 10
Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards .	59 6 1 2 6 1 20 121 16 32 6 0 1 13 32 35 0 0 1 10
A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum 's financial future .	6 0 0 1 12 6 1 4 19 6 1 38 1 42 0 1 10
When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward .	39 6 1 20 35 121 120 67 35 18 19 1 2 32 0 1 13 52 1 12 0 1 28 24 10
But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting .	76 6 1 28 24 106 13 53 7 1 12 1 13 1 106 30 1 37 120 10
You say you could have sold X percent of this product and Y percent of that , recalls Theodore Semegran , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer .	23 44 23 4 163 21 0 1 12 6 1 13 0 1 12 23 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 33 34 38 6 1 38 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
And then you still have to negotiate .	76 76 23 16 154 18 79 10
Quantum hopes the Morris plant , where limited production got under way last week , will resume full operation by year 's end .	1 44 6 0 1 2 75 0 1 48 7 1 67 35 2 4 19 0 1 38 1 42 1 10
The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production .	6 1 16 48 7 0 1 132 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 13 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Not everything looks grim for Quantum .	52 23 28 24 38 1 10
The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity .	6 0 1 4 19 6 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 2 75 0 1 14 35 40 38 0 1 10
By lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs .	181 32 0 1 2 6 1 4 35 19 6 1 42 0 0 1 10
Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , propane marketing .	1 37 35 32 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 10
Through a venture with its investment banker , First Boston Corp. , Quantum completed in August an acquisition of Petrolane Inc. in a transaction valued at $ 1.18 billion .	59 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 1 11 38 1 6 1 12 0 1 38 6 1 22 7 86 0 9 10
Petrolane is the second-largest propane distributor in the U.S. .	1 11 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
The largest , Suburban Propane , was already owned by Quantum .	6 1 2 0 1 2 14 35 40 38 1 10
Still , Quantum has a crisis to get past right now .	76 2 1 11 6 1 18 87 7 67 35 10
Some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor .	6 1 44 6 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 10
The name surfacing in rumors is British Petroleum Co. , which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the U.S. .	6 1 120 38 1 11 0 0 1 2 33 37 113 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Asked about a bid for Quantum , a BP spokesman says , We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors , and I think that falls in that category .	22 7 6 1 12 1 2 6 0 1 44 2 23 72 16 11 6 1 93 16 45 7 1 2 13 23 44 23 34 38 6 1 10
RJR Nabisco Inc. is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time , just a month after moving 11 of the group 's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta .	0 0 1 37 32 6 1 24 399 32 0 0 1 2 52 6 1 310 32 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 38 0 1 38 1 10
A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant , taken private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit , and dismissing its 14 employees , in a move to save money .	6 1 12 6 36 0 1 13 0 1 2 152 24 67 81 1 38 6 125 0 9 0 1 38 0 0 0 0 1 2 65 66 23 37 32 35 6 0 0 0 1 2 13 32 6 0 1 2 38 6 1 18 19 1 10
The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms , FCB\/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson .	6 1 44 1 37 32 6 0 1 38 6 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 10
We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost , said the spokesman , who declined to specify how much RJR spends on network television time .	23 65 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 66 6 0 1 4 19 62 62 52 6 1 38 36 0 1 2 56 6 1 2 33 64 18 194 376 1 1 73 7 0 0 1 10
An executive close to the company said RJR is spending about $ 140 million on network television time this year , down from roughly $ 200 million last year .	6 1 24 84 6 1 44 1 37 111 0 86 0 9 7 0 0 1 81 1 2 70 7 0 86 0 9 69 78 10
The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1 , and the move wo n't affect RJR 's print , radio and spot-television buying practices .	6 1 44 6 0 1 4 74 40 8 9 2 13 6 1 4 35 19 1 42 0 2 0 13 0 0 1 10
The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago , when RJR 's previous management moved it to Atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer .	6 0 1 20 151 40 38 0 1 140 6 1 3 2 117 1 42 0 1 11 23 38 1 2 6 1 42 1 38 6 1 10
One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because there was supposed to be a future .	0 1 12 6 1 44 1 11 0 1 12 6 1 70 7 0 1 38 1 30 50 610 17 18 19 6 1 10
He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies .	23 44 6 1 11 0 0 1 38 6 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 32 23 38 1 12 0 1 10
The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' upcoming season .	6 0 1 44 6 1 11 6 0 1 38 0 1 67 35 30 6 1 20 35 169 7 6 1 93 32 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 10
The studies -LCB- on closing the unit -RCB- could n't be completed until now , he said .	6 1 166 93 32 6 1 167 4 35 74 40 38 1 2 23 27 10
The group 's president , Peter Chrisanthopoulos , was n't in his office Friday afternoon to comment .	6 1 42 1 2 0 1 2 48 35 7 6 1 67 35 18 79 10
The U.S. , which is finalizing its steel-import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries .	6 1 2 33 37 32 6 0 1 2 37 111 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 7 0 13 36 0 1 33 11 36 0 0 1 10
Meanwhile , the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community .	76 2 6 1 20 21 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 2 13 21 52 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas , which expired Sept. 30 .	1 2 24 84 1 13 0 1 2 14 17 18 19 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 611 23 40 38 6 0 0 0 1 2 33 34 8 9 10
Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990 .	1 13 1 11 6 0 0 1 33 20 35 21 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 120 8 9 2 208 10
In recent years , U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation .	59 0 1 2 0 1 20 21 36 0 1 12 6 36 0 1 12 1 40 35 38 6 1 10
Of the remaining 20 % needed , the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which is n't included in the quota program .	59 6 0 0 1 40 2 6 0 1 73 36 0 1 7 0 1 2 441 6 1 40 67 38 1 106 33 14 35 40 38 6 0 1 10
Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel .	0 1 33 4 35 19 0 0 1 12 6 1 2 69 12 1 2 1 13 1 2 16 20 21 1 10
Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas .	23 12 6 1 20 38 0 1 21 0 1 12 6 1 33 28 53 7 1 10
The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until March 31 , 1992 .	6 0 1 72 188 1 44 23 4 19 0 1 2 22 7 0 0 1 2 38 86 9 2 123 10
It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments .	23 16 44 23 4 19 6 0 210 1 18 87 7 6 0 1 93 32 35 6 0 0 1 2 33 20 151 16 40 2 40 13 40 38 1 10

Mexico , which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S. , virtually doubled its quota to 0.95 % of the U.S. steel market from 0.48 % under the previous quotas .	1 2 33 11 1 12 6 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 16 11 6 1 38 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 38 0 1 12 6 0 1 10

The EC steel industry , which has been coping with strong European demand , has been supplying about 5 % of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 % .	6 0 0 1 2 33 20 121 45 7 0 0 1 2 20 121 32 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 230 7 0 1 12 36 0 1 10

In the recent talks , the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons , to 7 % of the U.S. market from 6.7 % in 1988 .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 461 6 1 60 96 67 35 2 38 0 1 12 6 0 1 38 0 1 68 1 10
But its quota has been as high as 6.9 % in 1984 .	76 6 1 20 164 29 53 7 0 1 12 1 10
Japan , however , has agreed to cut its quota to about 5 % from 5.9 % previously .	1 2 16 2 20 94 18 19 6 1 38 36 0 1 38 0 1 208 10
Japan , the EC , Brazil , Mexico and South Korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program .	1 2 6 1 2 1 2 1 13 0 1 11 36 0 1 12 6 1 40 38 6 1 38 6 0 1 10
The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela .	6 1 14 40 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 69 12 1 13 1 10
The U.S. had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks .	6 1 11 52 52 52 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 18 5 7 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
That was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting Japan 's allowance .	23 14 35 22 35 7 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 0 1 93 32 1 42 1 10

These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration 's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries .	6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 14 22 7 6 0 1 42 0 1 18 221 6 1 1 12 0 0 1 18 154 18 134 23 18 19 1 13 1 38 6 0 0 1 10

Revenue totaled $ 5 million .	1 11 86 0 9 10

The lower results , Mr. Pierce said , reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones , Elcotel 's primary business .	6 0 1 2 0 1 44 2 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 36 0 0 1 2 1 42 0 1 10
Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year , he said Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas .	39 0 1 82 6 1 12 1 18 79 38 6 0 1 2 23 44 1 4 35 87 155 120 38 0 1 10

Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company 's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls .	1 20 35 21 6 0 0 1 33 4 5 0 1 7 6 1 42 1 93 32 13 32 0 1 13 0 1 10

Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload .	0 0 0 1 64 18 168 32 67 35 6 0 1 33 4 19 52 52 6 1 12 1 10
The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds .	6 1 34 38 1 40 38 1 75 0 1 20 21 0 1 38 0 1 10
It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as Kao Corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S. .	23 16 11 1 42 0 80 66 6 0 1 2 69 12 0 1 2 4 19 6 1 38 6 1 10
The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets .	6 0 0 1 14 40 0 1 26 38 1 30 1 11 6 0 1 2 15 1 2 33 16 11 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
They do n't want to get caught again , says one industry watcher .	23 4 35 154 18 74 40 35 2 56 0 0 1 10
Retailers in Phoenix , Ariz. , say P&G 's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November .	1 12 1 2 1 2 44 1 42 0 0 1 106 18 74 15 1 12 0 1 106 4 87 7 1 12 6 1 38 0 1 10
A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month .	6 0 1 65 66 1 12 1 34 67 67 35 10
She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others .	23 44 6 1 4 19 1 12 6 1 57 120 38 1 10
Superconcentrates are n't entirely new for P&G .	1 28 35 29 24 38 1 10
The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack .	6 1 11 6 0 0 1 38 1 57 32 6 1 12 1 10
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % .	39 1 11 6 1 38 1 2 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 34 38 36 0 1 38 24 25 0 1 10
With the help of Lemon Cheer , P&G 's share is now estimated to be 12 % .	59 6 1 12 0 1 2 1 42 1 14 35 17 18 19 0 1 10
While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders .	39 6 1 20 21 6 0 1 13 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 4 87 7 6 125 0 9 0 0 1 2 75 1 28 24 13 1 20 21 1 12 1 10
The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach .	6 1 4 163 94 18 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 30 23 20 35 21 6 0 1 38 0 0 1 2 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 1 12 1 10
With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry .	59 1 2 76 2 192 193 35 35 24 18 543 1 66 1 28 24 91 0 1 64 18 19 36 0 1 38 6 0 1 2 207 66 192 390 6 1 12 1 18 16 19 6 1 10
In the early 1980s , P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe .	59 6 0 1 2 1 64 18 19 35 6 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 138 23 11 38 1 10
But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped .	76 6 1 2 33 28 35 29 53 7 6 0 1 2 34 38 6 0 1 12 1 13 14 40 10
P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .	1 13 1 16 20 94 35 18 5 1 7 0 13 0 0 1 12 1 2 13 23 20 35 60 35 2 38 6 1 10
But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading .	76 1 44 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 33 16 11 6 1 33 73 1 155 120 10
And retailers are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space .	76 1 14 17 18 19 6 1 2 97 1 30 23 4 19 35 0 0 1 10
When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , says Hugh Zurkuhlen , an analyst at Salomon Bros .	39 0 1 28 24 2 1 28 24 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 10
But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case .	76 347 36 0 1 45 7 1 2 23 11 67 35 6 1 10
If the new Cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates .	39 6 0 1 34 35 2 6 1 12 0 1 28 43 18 79 30 1 34 38 6 0 1 10
Then retailers will probably push the -LCB- less-established -RCB- brands out altogether , he says .	76 1 4 35 19 6 662 24 167 1 35 35 2 23 27 10
Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. .	1 28 43 18 115 24 30 1 11 6 1 12 1 38 6 1 10
To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G , which has about 23 % of the market .	18 115 24 2 1 4 35 19 6 0 1 32 0 0 1 70 7 6 0 1 2 33 11 36 0 1 12 6 1 10
Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co. , a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker .	0 1 16 20 173 23 28 53 155 32 1 38 6 1 2 13 137 76 6 1 20 169 7 1 2 69 12 0 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 10
It also has a product-testing facility in California .	23 16 11 6 0 1 38 1 10
Some believe P&G 's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese .	23 44 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 34 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
This is something P&G would do with or without Kao , says Mr. Zurkuhlen .	23 11 23 1 4 19 38 13 38 1 2 56 0 1 10
With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening , many Japanese had feared last week 's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills .	347 0 1 12 6 1 13 1 120 2 0 1 20 21 0 1 42 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 10
They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. .	23 11 6 0 1 12 80 262 1 19 23 35 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view .	76 2 23 11 6 1 12 6 302 198 6 1 13 1 18 79 35 13 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher .	0 1 42 0 1 12 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 11 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 42 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 10
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade .	0 1 48 7 0 1 12 0 1 38 1 12 0 0 0 1 33 16 11 0 1 10
He said such results should be measurable in dollars and cents in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan .	23 44 52 1 4 115 365 7 1 13 1 155 32 6 0 0 1 12 1 10
But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action .	76 0 1 2 120 38 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 12 1 38 1 2 65 66 6 1 64 35 18 19 0 1 38 1 13 1 2 23 64 35 18 19 6 1 12 1 10
She added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest .	23 65 66 23 64 16 18 19 6 0 1 106 6 0 1 18 543 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 66 23 37 120 38 1 10
How such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months .	55 52 1 48 7 1 1110 185 115 24 38 1 10
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills .	0 13 0 1 11 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 10
Many called it simply a contrast in styles .	1 108 23 52 6 1 12 1 10
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic .	76 23 73 23 7 6 0 0 1 10
Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand .	1 44 6 0 1 4 215 6 1 12 6 1 37 156 53 7 1 10
And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade .	76 23 44 23 11 6 0 1 12 1 93 32 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 10
Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's , Mrs. Hills replied : I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration .	17 18 5 0 1 7 0 0 1 2 0 1 44 106 23 4 35 19 6 1 23 11 2 13 59 6 0 1 2 23 44 23 11 6 36 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly conciliatory .	76 24 25 0 0 1 33 34 35 38 23 38 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 44 6 1 16 28 29 24 10
I think my line has been very consistent , Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon .	23 44 6 1 20 164 29 24 2 0 1 27 153 6 0 1 491 185 10
I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement .	23 14 22 35 46 24 2 67 30 23 11 6 0 1 12 1 18 19 10

When she met the local press for the first time on Friday , Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill .	39 23 11 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 38 1 2 0 1 16 11 6 1 12 1 93 32 1 12 1 12 0 1 2 1 13 1 2 0 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10

Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise .	0 1 20 139 6 0 1 155 146 0 1 6 36 0 1 12 1 2 13 6 1 20 121 32 6 0 1 10

The oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year .	6 0 1 42 0 1 4 79 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability .	0 0 1 85 6 0 0 1 14 17 18 19 36 36 0 1 75 23 34 38 6 0 1 6 1 107 2 69 12 0 0 1 13 0 1 10
The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance .	6 0 1 4 79 81 1 2 13 1 28 43 18 115 24 2 0 1 13 1 44 2 32 80 66 1 4 19 6 0 1 10
The industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview .	6 1 37 32 6 1 78 12 1 13 69 12 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 2 27 153 6 1 10
That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general , he added .	6 1 4 35 19 0 13 0 0 1 12 6 1 158 24 2 23 27 10
He did n't forecast Phillips 's results .	23 20 35 21 1 42 1 10
But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings .	76 0 1 44 1 4 87 7 6 1 24 84 0 0 1 13 4 35 19 6 1 12 0 1 10

Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene , a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies .	24 145 118 48 7 6 1 12 1 2 6 0 0 1 40 38 0 1 38 0 0 1 10
It has plunged 13 % since July to around 26 cents a pound .	23 20 60 67 35 38 1 38 36 0 1 92 1 10
A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents , peaking at about 34 cents last December .	6 1 234 1 48 7 0 1 2 45 7 36 0 1 67 35 10
A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion .	6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 11 1 10
Beginning in mid-1987 , prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand .	122 7 1 2 1 37 120 30 6 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 11 1 10
Companies added capacity furiously .	1 11 1 35 10

Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker .	0 1 12 1 28 24 10
Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year , said William Randol , a securities analyst at First Boston Corp .	0 1 28 29 24 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 29 29 29 24 81 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't materialize .	0 0 1 34 67 35 18 87 7 6 0 0 0 1 12 1 13 1 33 4 35 79 10
The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period .	6 0 1 11 0 1 35 38 6 1 10
In addition , crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier , further pressuring profitability .	59 1 2 0 0 1 28 179 23 46 6 1 3 2 16 32 1 10
Refiners say margins picked up in September , and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter .	1 44 1 34 35 38 1 2 13 0 0 1 44 0 1 4 79 81 1 2 1023 76 200 7 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 10

Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year .	0 0 1 4 154 35 18 19 6 36 0 1 12 1 42 1 92 1 10
Prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations .	1 106 120 0 86 9 92 1 26 68 6 0 1 68 6 1 123 106 20 169 161 7 0 1 42 1 10
Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter .	1 20 164 29 24 63 40 2 13 23 16 34 38 6 0 1 10
We could see higher oil prices this year , said Bryan Jacoboski , an analyst at PaineWebber Inc .	23 4 19 0 0 1 81 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 10
That will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a barrel in the fourth quarter .	23 4 87 7 36 0 0 1 2 69 230 7 0 1 75 0 1 16 34 38 0 86 9 92 1 38 6 0 1 10
While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse .	39 0 1 20 164 24 63 40 2 0 0 1 20 164 24 10
In the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988 .	59 6 0 1 2 23 28 36 0 1 3 47 23 34 38 1 10
The main reason remains weather .	6 0 1 11 1 10
Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use .	0 1 28 53 7 6 0 1 13 1 33 82 1 18 19 0 0 1 18 19 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
This summer , on the other hand , had milder weather than usual .	6 1 2 85 6 0 1 2 11 0 1 158 24 10
We 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , said Mr. Cox , Phillips 's president .	23 20 164 29 53 7 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 42 1 10
The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected .	6 0 0 1 37 35 113 18 19 0 0 1 30 1 20 60 10
Going into the fourth quarter , natural gas prices are anywhere from 8 % to 17 % lower than a year earlier .	120 38 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 28 0 0 0 1 132 0 1 3 483 6 1 3 10
For instance , natural gas currently produced along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around $ 1.47 a thousand cubic feet , down 13 % from $ 1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago .	59 1 2 0 1 16 40 38 6 0 1 37 45 38 6 0 1 7 0 86 9 159 69 69 78 2 180 0 1 7 86 9 159 69 69 78 6 1 89 10
The Bush administration , trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc , is questioning whether Italy 's Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. supplied militarily valuable technology to the Soviets .	6 0 1 2 113 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 2 37 427 55 1 42 0 10 0 0 0 1 73 36 0 1 7 6 1 10
Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls , the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 .	1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 124 6 1 13 6 1 11 6 0 1 2 14 17 18 87 7 36 0 0 1 38 6 1 18 74 40 38 1 8 9 13 208 10
They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products .	23 64 18 87 161 7 6 1 12 1 32 1 12 0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 10
But the Bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization .	76 6 0 1 44 23 64 18 19 80 66 6 0 1 37 45 35 7 0 0 1 30 23 4 19 0 1 10
To make its point , it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft .	18 19 6 1 2 23 37 229 6 0 1 18 19 80 66 1 4 163 139 6 0 1 7 0 0 1 33 4 74 17 18 19 1 12 0 1 10
The London Sunday Times , which first reported the U.S. concerns , cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $ 25 million in embargoed , state-of-the-art , flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry .	6 0 0 1 2 33 16 11 6 0 1 2 73 6 0 0 1 7 6 1 12 6 80 66 1 11 86 0 9 12 0 2 0 2 0 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 10
Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984 .	1 16 37 32 6 1 38 1 10
A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom , but declined to confirm any details .	6 0 0 1 65 66 6 1 37 32 6 1 38 6 0 1 13 1 2 13 64 18 19 6 1 10
Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules .	0 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 54 55 1 11 0 1 10
President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader 's visit here last week .	0 1 73 6 1 7 6 1 38 6 0 1 42 1 69 69 78 10
Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities .	1 20 174 66 23 11 0 1 2 207 66 6 0 1 14 16 40 38 6 0 1 10
Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community .	39 6 1 12 6 1 11 35 6 0 1 2 6 1 4 35 74 16 40 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 13 6 0 1 10
It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting , said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies .	23 65 38 23 66 6 1 12 23 34 67 38 6 0 0 1 2 56 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies .	6 0 1 20 21 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 32 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Last summer , Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods .	137 76 2 0 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 30 23 308 6 0 0 0 0 1 66 23 4 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
But more recently , the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc .	76 137 76 2 6 1 13 6 0 1 16 34 38 6 1 12 124 1 4 19 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 10

There 's no evidence that the Soviet program to -LRB- illegally -RRB- acquire Western technology has diminished , said a State Department spokesman .	50 51 6 80 66 6 0 1 18 251 24 167 19 0 1 20 60 2 56 6 0 0 1 10

Bankers said warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors , wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market , an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk .	1 44 1 12 0 1 78 28 24 30 23 108 0 1 2 24 84 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 6 1 18 19 1 57 32 759 24 6 1 10
The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe , the bankers added , because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal .	6 0 0 0 1 4 115 53 7 1 12 1 2 6 1 44 2 30 6 1 11 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 33 11 0 1 10
Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock speculator Ivan F.

In a suit filed in federal court Thursday , the S&L alleged that a disproportionate number of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value .	59 6 1 40 38 0 1 35 2 6 1 65 66 6 0 1 12 6 1 23 11 38 1 34 38 1 10

Financial Corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F.

Shortly before the visit , Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51 % stake in the company .	137 59 6 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 20 169 7 0 0 1 13 20 21 6 1 12 1 18 19 6 36 0 1 12 6 1 10

Financial Corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $ 11 million in losses on them , the company said .	0 1 11 6 1 38 305 148 0 0 1 38 1 13 85 1 20 21 86 0 9 12 1 38 23 2 6 1 27 10
Ideal Basic Industries Inc. said its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for HOFI North America Inc. to combine its North American cement holdings with Ideal in a transaction that will leave Ideal 's minority shareholders with 12.8 % of the combined company .	0 0 0 1 44 6 1 11 6 1 12 1 565 198 0 0 0 1 18 5 6 36 0 0 1 7 1 38 6 1 33 4 5 1 42 0 1 7 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
HOFI , the North American holding company of Swiss concern Holderbank Financiere Glaris Ltd. , previously proposed combining its 100 % stake in St. Lawrence Cement Inc. and its 60 % stake in Dundee Cement Co. with its 67 % stake in Ideal .	1 2 6 36 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 16 37 111 6 36 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 13 6 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 7 6 36 0 1 12 1 10
But HOFI 's first offer would have given Ideal 's other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company .	76 1 42 0 1 4 163 114 1 42 0 1 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Ideal 's directors rejected that offer , although they said they endorsed the merger proposal .	1 42 1 11 6 1 2 30 23 44 23 11 6 0 1 10
Under the agreement , HOFI will own 87.2 % of the combined company .	59 6 1 2 1 4 19 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Ideal 's current operations will represent about 39.2 % of the combined company .	1 42 0 1 4 19 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by Ideal shareholders .	6 1 28 53 7 6 0 1 13 1 12 0 1 10

While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought-induced peaks of 1988 , wheat prices remain stubbornly high .	39 0 13 0 1 20 60 67 38 6 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 28 29 24 10

For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say .	59 0 1 2 137 347 0 1 32 0 0 1 81 1 38 1 2 0 0 1 28 43 18 19 1 67 38 1 2 6 1 27 10
And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies .	76 39 1 4 35 79 35 38 1 12 6 0 1 42 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 16 182 40 4 74 40 2 16 32 1 10

By next May 31 , stocks of U.S. wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to 443 million bushels .	59 0 86 9 2 1 12 0 1 18 74 40 35 38 6 0 1 106 30 6 0 1 16 182 40 14 40 106 14 17 18 79 38 36 0 1 10
That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s .	23 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Stocks were 698 million bushels on May 31 of this year .	1 11 36 0 1 38 86 9 12 6 1 10

It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 .	23 16 73 1 12 0 1 7 88 36 36 0 1 2 230 7 6 1 42 0 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 12 1 10

In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said Daniel Basse , a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago .	59 1 1263 148 2 0 1 69 78 4 178 6 0 0 1 53 7 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 10
Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade .	52 6 1 4 19 1 2 223 220 40 38 6 1 33 34 38 0 0 1 81 1 38 6 0 1 12 1 10

The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings .	6 1 44 23 65 66 6 1 4 35 115 43 18 19 0 1 18 79 13 4 154 18 79 38 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 33 20 21 1 18 19 6 1 10

Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said Conrad Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago .	36 36 2 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 12 0 1 12 1 13 1 37 113 18 19 6 1 12 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 13 1 12 0 1 12 1 10

The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months , further supporting prices .	6 0 1 20 35 21 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 13 0 1 82 1 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 16 32 1 10

Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop .	76 76 2 59 6 1 12 1 2 6 1 11 118 4 35 163 21 6 0 36 0 71 1 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10

However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 .	76 2 218 40 2 1 592 198 6 0 1 18 79 35 13 16 385 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 7 0 86 9 92 1 7 0 86 9 10
Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time .	1 42 0 1 12 0 1 11 416 0 1 6 0 1 4 163 21 13 11 6 0 0 0 1 38 366 24 7 0 1 92 1 38 0 1 10

But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks .	76 6 0 0 1 13 0 1 2 33 72 16 11 6 0 0 0 1 18 19 0 1 2 20 21 6 1 12 0 0 1 38 1 10
Last week , Saatchi 's largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring .	137 76 2 1 42 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 44 23 20 151 40 38 0 13 0 0 1 24 84 6 0 1 10
And Carl Spielvogel , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi .	76 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 1 42 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 44 23 20 94 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 13 14 40 38 0 1 10
Mr. Spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid .	0 1 44 23 4 35 19 6 0 1 10
The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders .	6 1 24 84 0 0 1 65 66 39 6 1 48 35 7 6 36 0 1 2 6 0 1 138 1 44 23 4 35 19 2 23 4 19 6 1 98 18 5 23 7 1 10
But -LCB- otherwise -RCB- it would undoubtedly come back with an offer by management .	76 109 24 167 23 4 35 87 35 7 6 1 12 1 10
The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi .	6 1 44 6 1 4 74 40 38 6 0 1 2 135 1 11 0 1 13 135 0 0 1 14 17 18 19 0 1 10
The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion .	6 1 4 35 19 6 1 2 13 0 1 20 173 1 4 19 0 650 86 0 9 10
The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back .	6 1 11 80 66 1 37 32 35 6 0 0 0 1 16 18 19 35 6 1 35 130 66 6 1 4 19 6 1 10

Retailers are just in disarray .	1 48 35 7 1 10
For instance , Gannett Co. posted an 11 % gain in net income , as total ad pages dropped at USA Today , but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates .	59 1 2 0 1 11 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 2 30 0 0 1 34 38 0 1 2 13 0 1 34 70 7 6 0 0 0 1 13 0 1 10

At USA Today , ad pages totaled 785 for the quarter , down 9.2 % from the 1988 period , which was helped by increased ad spending from the Summer Olympics .	59 0 1 2 0 1 11 1 38 6 1 2 180 0 1 7 6 0 1 2 33 14 40 38 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10

Washington Post Co. is expected to report improved earnings , largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the Washington area .	0 0 1 14 17 18 19 0 1 2 67 70 7 0 0 1 13 0 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
According to analysts , profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at Newsweek .	122 7 1 2 1 14 35 40 38 0 0 1 12 1 10
The news-weekly has faced heightened competition from rival Time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market .	6 1 20 21 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 6 36 0 0 0 1 10
Knight-Ridder Inc. is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its Detroit Free Press and Gannett 's Detroit News , and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter .	0 1 14 22 7 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 1 42 0 1 2 13 20 300 1 66 1 28 24 38 6 0 1 10

The Miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years when Knight-Ridder was starting up a Hispanic edition and circulation was falling , said Bruce Thorp , an analyst for Provident National Bank .	6 0 1 37 120 35 35 38 6 0 1 12 1 75 1 37 32 35 6 0 1 13 1 37 120 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
General Motors Corp. , in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity .	0 0 1 2 85 6 1 12 1 33 11 0 1 12 6 1 13 1 2 20 174 66 751 24 7 1 36 0 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 30 6 1 64 18 19 6 0 0 1 10
In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories .	59 1 12 1 69 69 78 2 1 16 11 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 2 13 73 0 1 7 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade .	1 48 7 0 1 18 19 1 33 28 24 30 6 0 0 1 42 0 0 1 34 38 6 0 1 10
The company , currently using about 80 % of its North American vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 .	6 1 2 16 32 36 0 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 2 20 173 23 4 79 38 0 1 12 1 38 1 10
Just a month ago , GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood , Ga. , the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987 .	52 6 1 234 2 1 44 23 4 221 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 18 79 12 1 10
Now , GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s .	76 2 1 64 18 168 32 35 6 1 12 6 0 1 18 87 7 1 12 6 1 10
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match .	0 1 11 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 33 37 32 35 24 25 36 0 1 92 1 38 1 24 47 1 4 79 10
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year .	23 65 66 0 0 0 0 1 20 173 23 73 0 0 1 7 6 0 0 0 0 1 33 4 74 40 67 35 10
GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .	0 1 64 18 19 6 1 18 19 1 13 6 0 1 38 1 30 6 1 34 10
The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs .	6 1 2 16 2 65 66 1 42 1 37 120 38 6 1 75 0 1 37 113 18 19 1 33 44 6 1 28 29 24 38 6 1 12 0 1 10
Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's flagrant insensitivity toward union members .	59 6 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 33 16 11 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 11 6 1 35 32 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 10
The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed disarray and an inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , Mr. Yokich said .	6 0 1 42 1 18 215 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 34 35 38 0 1 12 6 0 1 11 1 13 6 1013 13 1013 18 19 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves : Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint , Mich .	0 1 73 1 67 67 35 7 6 0 1 75 1 12 0 1 4 74 22 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 1 10
That means two plants -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 .	23 44 0 1 12 1 12 1 2 1 2 13 6 1 12 1 2 1 106 16 4 74 40 35 38 6 1 12 1 10
The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio .	6 1 4 19 36 0 0 0 1 13 36 0 1 12 1 10
Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney .	0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 82 6 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 0 0 1 13 6 1 2 0 0 0 1 10

Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars .	1 12 1 12 0 1 2 1 2 0 1 13 1 2 1 2 14 330 6 1 37 67 35 182 17 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 13 0 0 0 1 10
GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said .	1 37 427 55 23 4 19 6 0 1 35 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 1 2 0 13 0 1 27 10
That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures .	6 1 136 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 53 7 6 1 10
The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 .	6 0 0 1 2 33 11 36 0 1 2 4 35 19 6 1 18 19 38 1 10
Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a flex plant , which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand .	0 1 2 0 0 1 2 44 6 1 14 17 18 19 35 1 18 168 120 38 6 0 1 2 33 4 19 0 0 1 12 1 38 0 1 18 19 1 10
At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and none of us knows when the A-body cars will die .	59 6 0 0 1 2 33 11 36 0 1 32 6 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 44 6 1 175 6 0 1 40 35 2 13 1 12 23 162 55 6 0 1 4 79 10

At Pontiac , however , the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied , two-seater Pontiac Fiero model .	59 1 2 76 2 6 0 1 64 18 19 0 80 66 1 4 19 6 0 0 1 33 16 11 6 0 2 0 0 0 1 10
The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year .	6 0 1 14 22 7 6 1 12 0 1 38 1 30 0 1 12 6 1 82 6 1 18 19 6 1 67 35 10
Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result .	0 1 163 21 6 1 35 38 6 1 10

Institut Merieux S.A. of France said the Canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of Connaught BioSciences Inc. for 942 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 801.6 million -RRB- .	0 0 1 12 1 44 6 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 36 0 0 1 12 86 0 9 167 10
Merieux said the government 's minister of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of net benefit to Canada .	1 44 6 1 42 1 12 1 2 1 13 1 308 23 66 23 28 35 266 66 6 1 28 43 18 87 7 0 1 38 1 10
Canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard .	0 0 1 65 66 0 0 1 11 6 1 10
The French company said the government gave it 30 days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan .	6 0 1 44 6 1 108 23 0 1 12 754 18 19 1 18 35 19 6 0 1 10
Both Merieux and Connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns .	6 1 13 1 11 0 0 13 0 0 1 10
The government 's action was unusual .	6 1 42 1 28 24 10
Alan Nymark , executive vice president of Investment Canada , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company .	0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 11 0 1 2 44 23 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 75 6 1 20 21 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 36 0 1 10
He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed .	23 44 23 20 21 6 0 1 12 6 1 18 19 36 0 1 2 13 16 195 6 1 18 79 10
This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , said Jodi Redmond , press secretary for Harvie Andre , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology .	23 11 35 6 1 12 0 1 91 6 1 20 151 40 35 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 2 1 42 1 12 1 2 1 13 1 10
Mr. Andre issued the ruling based on a recommendation by Investment Canada .	0 1 11 6 1 70 7 6 1 12 0 1 10
Spokesmen for Merieux and Connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada , but added they hope to have more information early this week .	1 12 1 13 1 44 23 20 35 151 22 7 0 1 12 1 38 52 6 1 13 0 1 2 13 44 23 64 18 19 0 1 67 81 1 10
Investment Canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision .	0 1 64 18 87 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Viren Mehta , a partner with Mehta & Isaly , a New York-based pharmaceutical industry research firm , said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected .	0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 36 0 0 0 0 1 2 44 6 1 42 1 28 35 24 10
This has become a very politicized deal , concerning Canada 's only large , world-class bio-research or pharmaceutical company , Mr. Mehta said .	23 20 21 6 36 0 1 2 12 1 42 0 0 2 0 0 13 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
Mr. Mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of Connaught 's dispute with the University of Toronto .	0 1 44 6 1 33 4 134 6 1 18 79 35 223 40 4 19 6 0 1 12 1 42 1 12 6 1 12 1 10
The University is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in Canada .	6 1 37 113 18 19 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 2 32 1 12 6 1 12 1 33 4 74 40 38 1 10
The university is considering a settlement proposal made by Connaught .	6 1 37 32 6 0 1 40 38 1 10
While neither side will disclose its contents , Mr. Mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in Canada than Merieux offered to Investment Canada .	39 6 1 4 19 6 1 2 0 1 82 23 18 19 36 0 1 12 0 13 0 0 1 12 1 75 1 48 7 0 1 10
Some analysts , such as Murray Grossner of Toronto-based Richardson Greenshields Inc. , believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders , such as Switzerland 's Ciba-Geigy and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville , Calif .	6 1 2 69 12 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 44 6 0 1 136 6 1 53 7 0 1 2 69 12 1 42 1 13 0 1 12 1 2 1 10

Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future .	1 11 6 0 1 38 1 123 13 44 23 11 35 6 1 18 79 35 38 1 12 1 69 340 0 9 2 13 4 115 24 81 1 68 6 1 10

Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed to those companies ' older products , many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines .	36 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 14 22 7 6 1 42 0 1 2 1 12 361 11 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 10

Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its anti-cholesterol drug , Mevacor ; a high blood pressure medicine , Vasotec ; Primaxin , an antibiotic , and Pepcid , an anti-ulcer medication .	0 1 65 66 1 42 1 12 6 1 34 38 36 0 1 2 40 38 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 12 6 0 1 2 1 91 6 0 0 0 1 2 1 91 1 2 6 1 2 13 1 2 6 0 1 10

It 's turning out to be a real blockbuster , Mr. Sweig said .	23 37 113 35 18 19 6 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
In last year 's third quarter , Lilly earned $ 171.4 million , or $ 1.20 a share .	59 0 1 42 0 1 2 1 11 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 10

Squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18 % above the $ 123 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it earned in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease .	1 42 1 2 17 38 1 18 87 36 0 1 372 6 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 2 23 11 38 6 0 1 12 1 2 11 6 1 12 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 93 32 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 10

Bristol-Myers declined to comment .	1 64 18 79 10
Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % , and Bristol-Meyers 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are largely because those companies are really managed well .	0 1 12 0 1 65 66 0 1 42 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 132 0 1 2 13 1 42 0 0 1 12 36 0 1 397 76 346 6 1 14 35 40 35 10
ScheringPlough earned $ 94.4 million , or 84 cents a share , while Bristol-Myers earned $ 232.3 million , or 81 cents a share , in the like period a year earlier .	1 11 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 92 1 2 30 1 11 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 92 1 2 38 6 0 1 6 1 107 10
In Madison , N.J. , a spokesman for Schering-Plough said the company has no problems with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about 19 % , to $ 1 .	59 1 2 1 2 6 1 12 1 44 6 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 75 0 1 12 1 34 38 36 0 1 2 38 86 9 10

Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs , Feldene for treating arthritis , and Procardia , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased competition .	1 12 1 42 0 1 2 1 93 32 1 2 13 1 2 6 0 1 2 20 60 70 7 0 1 10

Analysts said they expected Upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2 % to 4 % as compared with $ 89.6 million , or 49 cents a share , it earned a year ago .	1 44 23 82 1 42 1 18 115 24 13 79 38 0 0 0 1 132 0 1 196 22 7 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 92 1 2 23 11 6 1 26 10
Upjohn 's biggest-selling drugs are Xanax , a tranquilizer , and Halcion , a sedative .	1 42 0 1 11 1 2 6 1 2 13 1 2 6 1 10
Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs .	1 12 6 1 20 151 40 38 0 0 1 32 6 1 12 0 0 1 13 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Also , the company 's hair-growing drug , Rogaine , is selling well -- at about $ 125 million for the year , but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by Upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising , analysts said .	76 2 6 1 42 0 1 2 1 2 37 120 35 67 38 0 86 0 9 12 6 1 2 13 6 1 42 1 12 6 1 20 151 40 38 1 42 0 0 13 0 1 12 1 2 1 27 10

In a lovely , novelistic memoir , Sleeping Arrangements -LRB- Knopf , 195 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , she remembers an exotic playground , peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic -LRB- real oddballs like her sexpot friend , the hell-kitten Diana , age five -RRB- .	59 6 0 2 0 1 2 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 86 9 167 2 23 11 6 0 1 2 40 67 38 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 1 123 167 10

She transforms her Bronx of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria into the Babylonian Bronx , a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue .	23 73 0 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 75 6 1 12 1 14 35 40 38 0 1 12 1 7 6 0 1 2 6 1 45 7 1 13 1 13 1 10
In the Babylonian Bronx , Jewish working-class people lived in drab , Soviet-style buildings glamorized with names like AnaMor Towers -LRB- after owners Anna and Morris Snezak -RRB- , whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks , friezes of Pompeii .	59 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 34 38 0 2 0 1 22 7 1 12 0 1 166 12 0 1 13 0 1 167 2 135 1 13 1 14 22 7 1 12 0 1 13 1 2 1 12 1 10
For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl : ... outwardly ordinary , inwardly ornate , owing all inspiration to heathen cultures .	59 0 1 6 0 1 11 6 1 23 11 120 38 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 106 106 29 24 2 29 24 2 111 6 1 7 0 1 10

The games Bronx children played -LRB- holding kids down and stripping them , for example -RRB- seem tame by today 's crack standards , but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure .	6 1 0 1 11 93 32 1 35 13 32 23 2 38 1 167 115 24 38 1 42 0 1 2 13 0 1 344 23 35 87 7 6 0 1 10

With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe , an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist -LRB- who rhymed river with liver in a love song -RRB- ; and Uncle Len , a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an undercover President on a good-will mission .	59 0 1 23 11 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 13 0 1 166 33 73 1 7 1 38 6 0 1 167 91 13 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 33 48 7 1 13 11 6 1 12 1 38 6 0 1 2 38 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10

Line by line Mr. Friedman 's weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he 's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it .	76 222 1 0 1 42 0 1 4 115 24 2 67 30 23 37 45 7 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 1 11 23 24 35 2 16 32 6 0 1 33 16 16 11 23 10

The company 's net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after the dividends are issued .	6 1 42 0 1 4 35 79 38 86 0 9 30 6 1 14 40 10
The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf 's reorganization , which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990 , said Lawrence R. Mehl , Gulf 's general counsel .	6 1 12 6 1 16 28 24 81 1 68 1 42 1 2 1111 23 232 4 79 35 38 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 42 0 1 10
In addition , Gulf must give the government 20 days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ 50 million that are made to the Bermuda-based holding company .	59 1 2 1 4 221 6 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 32 86 0 9 33 14 22 7 6 0 0 1 10
Gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ 150 million .	1 42 0 1 12 6 1 4 19 396 148 86 0 9 10
Separately , the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 to vote on its proposed reorganization .	76 2 6 1 44 23 64 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 38 0 1 18 87 7 6 0 1 10
Many of the nation 's highest-ranking executives saluted Friday 's market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players .	1 12 6 1 42 0 1 73 1 42 0 1 7 6 0 1 12 1 13 0 1 10
Assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some executives think Friday 's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating .	207 66 6 1 4 35 79 38 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 44 1 42 1 4 19 6 1 12 0 1 106 12 6 80 66 6 0 1 13 0 1 12 0 1 4 168 120 10
This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations , rather than to any fundamentals , said John Young , chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co. , whose shares dropped $ 3.125 to $ 48.125 .	23 11 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 102 13 12 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 2 135 1 34 8 9 38 86 9 10
If we get rid of a lot of that nonsense , it will be a big plus .	39 23 28 53 7 6 1 12 6 1 2 23 4 19 6 0 1 10
A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council , a group that meets to discuss national issues , were only too happy to personalize their criticism .	6 1 12 6 1 230 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 33 64 18 19 0 1 2 28 29 355 24 18 19 6 1 10
People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs , do something about takeovers , do something about Donald Trump , said Rand Araskog , chairman of ITT Corp. , whose stock dropped $ 3.375 .	1 44 6 1 4 5 23 7 0 1 2 5 23 7 1 2 5 23 7 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 2 135 1 34 8 9 10

I 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline , said Kenneth Olsen , Digital Equipment Corp. president , who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company 's shares plunged $ 5.75 to close at $ 86.50 .	23 37 35 113 18 87 7 0 1 42 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 33 37 16 120 38 6 0 0 13 0 1 12 6 1 78 30 6 1 42 1 64 8 9 18 87 7 86 9 10
I did n't bother calling anybody ; I did n't even turn on TV .	23 4 35 168 32 23 91 23 4 35 35 19 35 1 10
There has n't been any fundamental change in the economy , added John Smale , whose Procter & Gamble Co. took an $ 8.75 slide to close at $ 120.75 .	50 150 35 21 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 75 0 0 0 1 82 6 125 9 1 18 87 7 86 9 10
The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem .	6 80 66 23 34 0 1 26 13 50 51 6 1 108 1 6 80 66 23 4 35 19 6 1 10
Of course , established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists .	59 1 2 0 0 1 16 64 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 10
Indeed , one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday 's events was Robert Crandall , chairman of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump .	76 2 0 0 1 33 28 29 53 7 1 42 1 11 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 13 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Asked whether Friday 's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the New York real estate magnate , Mr. Crandall smiled broadly and said : No comment .	317 55 1 42 1 4 344 23 168 182 40 38 6 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 34 35 13 34 38 6 1 10
On Friday morning , before the market 's sell-off , the business leaders issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted 2 % annual rate , through next year , then accelerate anew in 1991 .	59 0 1 2 59 6 1 42 1 2 6 0 1 11 6 1 214 6 1 4 79 38 52 6 0 36 0 0 1 2 38 0 1 2 16 79 35 38 1 10
Of the 19 economists who worked on the Business Council forecast , only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years , and in both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession , said Lewis Preston , chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co. and vice chairman of the Business Council .	59 6 0 1 33 34 38 6 0 0 1 2 0 1 11 1 12 1 12 6 1 42 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 13 59 6 1 6 1 28 355 24 18 19 6 1 78 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 0 1 13 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market .	6 0 0 1 33 37 32 35 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 13 1 37 35 32 6 1 42 0 0 0 1 10
In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill .	59 1 2 0 0 1 28 24 13 36 0 1 20 164 43 18 79 10
Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom .	0 0 0 1 44 1 28 43 18 19 1 70 7 1 12 6 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 80 66 1 20 35 35 21 1 10
There is an unbelievable amount of space available , says Faith Consolo , senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc .	50 51 6 0 1 12 1 24 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 10
There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 .	50 51 36 0 1 12 1 2 70 7 6 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
This further confuses retailers , she says .	23 16 11 1 2 23 27 10
They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ?	23 249 244 23 19 6 1 104 1 37 35 120 35 10
Is this the wrong time to open a store ?	405 23 6 0 1 18 19 6 1 10
Who is going to be in the space next door ?	246 37 113 18 87 7 6 1 78 250 10
In addition , Ms. Consolo says , tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one-quarter lower than landlords ' initial asking price .	59 1 2 0 1 44 2 1 16 4 154 18 19 1 33 28 0 1 3 84 1 42 0 0 1 10
A handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents .	6 1 12 0 0 1 2 69 12 6 0 0 13 0 13 0 0 1 2 20 164 43 18 19 119 23 73 7 0 1 10
And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau .	76 2 59 6 1 2 1 20 35 21 6 1 10
But on average , Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say .	76 59 1 2 0 0 1 20 60 67 35 459 67 35 38 6 0 0 1 78 2 1 27 10
That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 .	23 11 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 75 1 78 20 60 35 35 38 1 10
The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing .	6 0 1 32 1 12 0 1 20 21 1 10
As businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks , says Edward A. Friedman , senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc .	39 1 34 13 34 2 6 1 12 1 33 4 19 0 1 34 2 56 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market .	23 44 0 1 32 0 2 0 13 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 106 20 16 21 6 1 10
Hardest hit are what he calls secondary sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents .	16 79 245 119 23 108 0 1 33 16 11 0 1 10
In these locations , Mr. Friedman says , Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined .	59 6 1 2 0 1 44 2 1 28 29 53 155 120 13 1 20 164 24 13 85 6 1 20 60 10
Weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , exacerbates the problem for landlords .	1 12 6 0 1 2 33 37 327 0 1 24 2 11 6 1 38 1 10
It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt .	192 940 35 6 1 12 1 13 0 0 0 1 55 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 33 11 0 1 2 48 7 1 10
Hooker Corp. , parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman 's , is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner , Campeau Corp .	0 1 2 1 12 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 14 40 38 0 1 13 0 1 48 7 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 10
The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents .	6 1 12 0 1 4 115 24 130 66 6 1 12 0 1 37 32 6 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
But , despite the recent softening , for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s , when their leases were signed .	76 2 59 6 0 1 2 59 23 12 6 1 50 150 35 21 759 24 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 75 6 1 14 40 10
Certainly , the recent drop in prices does n't mean Manhattan comes cheap .	76 2 6 0 1 12 1 4 35 215 1 28 24 10
New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities .	0 0 0 1 16 34 67 38 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon .	1 13 0 1 13 0 0 1 4 19 1 12 0 0 86 9 92 0 1 2 13 86 9 28 29 24 10
The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $ 100 a square foot , as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue .	6 0 0 0 1 11 1 12 0 86 9 92 0 1 2 297 206 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
By contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in Boston , San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $ 100 a square foot .	59 1 2 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 13 1 16 11 86 9 92 0 1 10
And rents on Beverly Hills ' Rodeo Drive generally do n't exceed about $ 125 a square foot .	76 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 16 4 35 19 0 86 9 92 0 1 10

When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today , the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure .	39 0 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 35 2 6 1 4 87 35 7 0 1 12 6 1 10
For the first time , the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority .	59 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 11 6 1 96 67 38 1 2 102 13 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 42 1 10
This role reversal holds true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , Justices Thurgood Marshall , Harry Blackmun and John Stevens .	6 0 1 28 24 2 67 35 2 38 6 0 0 13 0 1 2 0 0 0 2 0 1 13 0 1 10
But are these four players , three of them in their 80s , ready to assume a different role after 88 years , collectively , of service on the high court ?	76 343 6 0 1 2 1 12 23 12 6 1 2 43 18 19 6 0 1 38 0 1 2 78 2 12 1 12 6 0 1 10
Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways .	6 1 65 66 6 1 28 43 18 19 6 0 1 2 13 6 1 33 48 7 23 2 13 38 0 1 10
Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it ; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad .	0 1 13 1 28 53 7 23 91 0 1 13 1 28 29 24 10
The four justices are no newcomers to dissent , often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court 's conservative drift .	6 0 1 11 6 1 12 1 2 16 32 1 38 6 0 1 18 19 6 1 42 0 1 10
But always , in years past , they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases .	76 76 2 59 1 24 2 23 20 21 6 1 13 368 28 43 18 19 35 6 0 1 18 19 35 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 10
Now , however , as the court 's new five-member conservative majority continues to solidify , victories for the liberals are rare .	76 2 76 2 39 6 1 42 0 0 0 1 64 18 79 2 1 12 6 1 28 24 10
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan , the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren .	6 1 28 29 24 38 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the height of the Warren Court 's power , Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court .	59 6 0 0 0 1 295 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 42 1 2 0 1 11 36 0 0 1 38 0 1 40 38 6 1 10
Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions , with the contentious flag-burning ruling as his only big victory .	137 76 105 23 11 0 0 1 38 0 1 2 38 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech .	76 0 1 11 6 0 1 2 16 32 6 1 12 1 38 6 0 1 10
Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , he said .	103 1 6 1 11 6 1 2 6 1 4 74 17 38 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 13 18 19 6 1 2 23 27 10
Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future .	76 2 59 0 1 23 20 174 66 39 23 48 7 6 0 1 38 6 1 2 23 65 66 6 1 4 79 38 6 1 10
He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions .	23 20 174 66 23 16 162 55 0 0 1 34 2 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 33 11 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 42 1 10
Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights .	1 12 0 0 1 215 23 28 53 7 6 1 42 1 67 35 2 13 28 53 7 6 1 13 43 18 79 35 38 6 1 42 1 12 0 1 10
We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , he said in a speech last month .	23 4 19 23 38 6 1 13 19 23 2 13 23 37 35 113 18 19 23 2 23 27 153 6 1 491 185 10

The dissenters in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon .	6 1 12 6 0 1 2 23 44 2 64 18 168 120 38 6 1 2 207 66 6 1 42 1 4 79 35 10
Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , he says .	1 13 1 37 45 38 6 1 7 6 36 0 1 2 23 27 10
Justice Blackmun , who will turn 81 next month , also seems feisty about his new role .	0 1 2 33 4 19 1 67 35 2 16 28 53 7 6 0 1 10

Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years .	1 13 1 33 11 0 1 38 6 1 44 23 28 116 29 53 7 6 1 213 7 0 1 10
And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August .	76 6 1 34 38 0 0 1 12 1 10
But his level of frustration showed in a recent , impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago .	76 6 1 12 1 34 38 6 0 2 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 1 12 1 10
He concluded his remarks by quoting , emotionally and at some length , according to those present , the late Martin Luther King 's famous I Have a Dream speech from the 1963 March on Washington .	23 11 6 1 57 120 2 35 13 38 6 1 2 70 7 23 24 2 6 0 0 0 1 42 0 23 11 6 1 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others .	0 1 2 1 2 11 35 6 0 1 217 6 1 217 6 1 2 97 1 30 23 4 19 6 1 123 12 6 1 2 13 35 30 23 11 6 0 1 93 45 7 6 1 35 68 6 1 10
If the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history , it also differs in an important way from recent history , court watchers say .	39 6 1 6 0 1 37 32 11 6 0 1 38 0 0 0 1 2 23 16 48 38 6 0 1 7 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited , says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School , but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created .	6 1 12 6 0 1 37 35 32 6 0 1 138 23 11 2 1265 0 0 0 1 12 314 1 217 1 0 1 2 13 6 1 78 37 32 6 1 138 23 11 10
The government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions , in its first wave of sales of big , sick thrifts , but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth .	6 1 11 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 38 6 0 1 12 1 12 0 2 0 1 2 13 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 10
The four S&Ls were sold to large banks , as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated by the Resolution Trust Corp. since it was created in the S&L bailout legislation two months ago .	6 0 1 14 22 7 0 1 2 223 15 6 1 38 1 12 6 0 0 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 30 23 14 40 38 6 0 0 1 0 1 26 10
Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , which has aggressively expanded its markets , particularly in Texas and Florida .	1 12 6 0 0 1 14 22 7 0 1 2 78 2 78 2 33 20 16 21 6 1 2 67 38 1 13 1 10
A Canadian bank bought another thrift , in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank .	6 0 1 11 6 1 2 38 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Under these deals , the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets .	59 6 1 2 6 1 11 52 6 1 13 6 0 1 10
These clean-bank transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later .	6 0 1 73 6 1 12 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 7 6 1 2 18 74 40 35 10
In these four , for instance , the RTC is stuck with $ 4.51 billion in bad assets .	59 6 1 2 59 1 2 6 1 14 22 7 86 0 9 12 0 1 10
Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5 % to 3.7 % for the deposits and branch systems , roughly in line with what analysts were expecting .	1 73 1 120 97 0 1 38 0 1 7 6 1 13 0 1 2 67 38 1 12 119 1 37 32 10
The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks , as has been the case with previous deals .	6 1 4 35 74 22 7 0 1 38 36 0 1 2 90 20 21 6 1 38 0 1 10
After that , the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts .	59 23 2 6 1 4 19 6 1 40 38 6 0 1 10
But it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps .	76 192 331 24 55 6 1 4 19 6 1 10
NCNB , for example , has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market , and in Florida , rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities .	1 2 85 1 2 20 21 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 13 59 1 2 1 28 29 24 38 0 1 10
The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency .	6 1 20 35 139 0 1 7 0 1 322 1 18 19 1 38 0 0 1 2 13 6 1 11 6 0 1 32 6 1 10
These thrifts are beached whales , said Bert Ely , an industry consultant based in Alexandria , Va .	6 1 11 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 40 38 1 2 1 10
For example , the delay in selling People 's Heritage Savings , Salina , Kan. , with $ 1.7 billion in assets , has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch-by-branch , instead of as a whole institution .	59 1 2 6 1 93 32 1 42 0 1 2 78 2 78 2 12 86 0 9 12 1 2 20 195 6 1 18 168 32 35 6 1 35 2 102 13 38 6 0 1 10
NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets .	1 11 6 1 12 6 0 13 0 1 10

As a measure of the depths to which the Texas real estate market has sunk , the RTC will pay $ 3.8 billion to NCNB to take $ 750 million of bad assets .	59 6 1 12 6 1 12 124 6 0 0 0 1 20 60 2 6 1 4 5 86 0 9 7 1 18 19 86 0 9 12 0 1 10

NCNB will also acquire $ 266 million of Freedom 's assets from the RTC , which will require $ 875 million in assistance .	1 4 35 5 86 0 9 12 1 42 1 7 6 1 2 33 4 19 86 0 9 12 1 10

Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways .	0 1 2 85 6 1 18 19 6 1 93 32 0 1 2 37 32 6 0 1 12 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 32 6 0 1 13 45 35 7 0 1 10
In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will dramatically de-emphasize its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 .	59 6 1 12 6 1 69 78 2 1 12 0 0 1 42 0 1 44 1 4 16 19 6 1 12 0 1 69 12 1 12 0 0 1 91 19 6 1 23 108 1 38 1 2 38 0 1 91 13 19 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 38 0 86 9 38 86 9 10
In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 2 85 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 44 23 4 35 19 6 0 1 38 1 91 6 0 2 0 1 12 6 1 11 0 86 9 10
However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher .	76 2 39 6 0 0 1 37 182 40 2 0 1 4 115 35 0 1 3 84 1 2 70 7 0 1 2 0 0 1 10
Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers .	1 37 32 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 33 85 0 1 20 21 6 0 80 66 32 36 0 2 13 0 2 1 11 6 1 18 19 1 10
In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers .	59 0 1 2 1 42 1 2 0 0 0 1 42 0 1 2 13 62 52 0 1 42 0 1 2 20 21 6 0 0 0 1 18 19 0 1 13 19 35 1 12 1 10
Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies .	0 1 12 1 13 1 12 0 0 1 13 1 20 21 0 1 93 32 0 1 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
But Time , as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks .	76 1 2 85 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 2 64 18 5 23 35 7 0 1 10
Besides , Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky .	76 2 0 1 44 32 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 28 24 10
Giveaways just give people the wrong image , said Mr. Heinemann .	1 16 108 1 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 10
That perception takes the focus off the magazine .	6 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 10
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers .	0 0 1 16 73 6 0 1 7 6 1 12 1 13 52 6 1 12 1 10
What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it , said Mr. Heinemann .	119 23 37 32 37 32 35 6 1 33 28 116 29 53 7 6 1 13 4 35 35 19 23 2 56 0 1 10
We are trying to create quality and involvement .	23 37 113 18 19 1 13 1 10
However , Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million .	76 2 0 1 11 6 0 1 30 59 1 123 6 1 11 6 0 1 38 0 1 38 0 1 10
And Time 's paid circulation , according to Audit Bureau of Circulations , dropped 7.3 % to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30 , 1989 .	76 1 42 0 1 2 415 7 0 1 12 1 2 34 67 35 38 1 38 6 0 1 40 8 9 2 208 10
Still , Time 's move is being received well , once again .	76 2 1 42 1 37 182 40 35 2 67 35 10
It 's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more , said Michael Drexler , national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency .	192 197 24 198 1 18 215 6 1 4 168 32 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
A few drops in circulation are of no consequence .	6 0 1 12 1 48 7 6 1 10
It 's not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits .	23 11 35 6 1 12 1 91 23 37 32 6 1 12 1 57 32 6 1 10
Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away .	0 1 44 6 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 12 1 2 13 6 0 1 12 1 75 1 13 6 1 12 1 20 151 40 35 10
The question is how much are we getting from each reader , said Mr. Heinemann .	6 1 586 454 1 549 23 111 7 6 1 2 56 0 1 10
Time 's rivals news-weeklies , Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report , are less reliant on electronic giveaways , and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases .	1 42 0 1 2 0 0 1 42 1 13 0 0 0 0 1 2 28 29 53 7 0 1 2 13 59 0 1 23 20 121 32 6 0 0 1 10
Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month .	6 1 14 17 18 19 6 0 1 13 0 1 12 1 38 6 1 10
When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago , Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing .	39 6 1 34 38 6 0 1 12 1 0 1 26 2 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 38 6 1 10
They said , follow CNN , he told reporters .	23 4 2 19 1 2 23 381 1 10
That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news .	23 162 336 24 0 1 42 0 0 1 20 60 38 6 1 0 1 107 2 75 23 14 15 6 1 12 0 1 10
It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks .	23 28 24 2 24 13 29 24 84 6 0 1 12 23 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
Its niche as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences around the world .	6 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 11 0 1 38 6 1 10
But for all its success , CNN has hit a plateau .	76 59 52 6 1 2 1 20 21 6 1 10
Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm .	39 1 34 30 0 1 34 2 23 34 38 1 12 1 10
CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV .	0 1 65 66 6 1 42 0 13 0 0 1 4 168 156 24 13 4 35 276 1 120 35 30 6 1 34 38 1 13 1 38 1 10
Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , says Ed Turner , CNN 's executive vice president , news gathering -LRB- and no relation to Ted Turner -RRB- .	52 6 255 23 28 24 67 35 11 67 35 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 42 0 0 1 2 0 1 166 13 6 1 12 0 1 167 10
You ca n't live on that .	23 4 35 87 7 23 10
So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network .	76 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 2 37 113 18 5 23 7 6 0 1 2 13 119 1 12 6 0 1 108 6 0 71 1 1 10
Tonight , to kick off the effort , CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years , an hourlong show at 6 p.m . Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts .	76 2 18 19 35 6 1 2 1 4 19 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 10 0 1 18 79 35 38 6 0 1 10
The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier , a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism .	6 1 4 74 40 38 0 1 13 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 33 20 35 21 6 1 12 1 13 1 10
The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length signature programming with recognizable stars .	6 0 1 11 35 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 6 1 37 32 18 19 0 1 57 120 70 7 6 0 1 38 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program .	18 19 23 2 1 37 35 32 0 1 13 32 6 0 0 1 10
It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers .	23 37 32 0 1 106 38 1 12 1 106 18 19 13 19 0 1 10
And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team .	76 23 37 45 7 6 0 1 18 19 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 10
The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , says Jon Petrovich , executive vice president of Headline News , CNN 's sister network .	6 0 1 64 18 79 38 6 0 1 33 73 23 7 6 1 12 1 18 19 6 1 12 1 38 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 1 42 0 1 10
But that wo n't be easy .	76 23 4 35 115 24 10
Networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change .	1 2 85 0 0 1 2 11 1 12 1 42 1 33 28 35 127 18 19 10
And the cable-TV operators -- CNN 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are .	76 6 0 1 12 1 42 1 13 0 1 106 108 1 52 6 1 23 11 10
The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive .	6 0 1 14 22 7 1 42 0 1 106 13 118 4 87 7 23 30 6 0 0 1 28 29 24 10
Already , CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co.

CNN wants to change its viewers ' habits .	1 64 18 19 6 1 42 1 10
Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping grazers and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research .	6 1 11 2 38 6 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 2 33 235 6 1 12 36 0 1 92 1 32 1 2 70 7 0 1 10
That 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks .	23 11 24 61 52 6 1 75 1 11 6 0 0 1 10
The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels .	6 0 1 1 108 1 4 5 23 7 6 1 30 0 1 2 13 1 2 28 29 53 7 0 1 10
CNN 's viewer habits have been molded by its format .	1 42 0 1 20 151 40 38 6 1 10
Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service .	6 1 12 6 1 20 94 18 87 7 6 0 0 1 10
It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks .	23 48 155 32 35 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 30 39 1 11 1 23 4 115 24 35 13 35 68 0 1 10
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called Daybreak , Daywatch , Newsday , and Newsnight , but the shows varied little in content , personality or look .	23 73 6 0 1 7 1 15 1 2 1 2 1 2 13 1 2 13 6 1 34 35 38 1 2 1 13 1 10
Now , the push is on for more-distinctive shows .	76 2 6 1 28 24 38 0 1 10
Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , says Paul Amos , CNN executive vice president for programming .	6 1 64 18 19 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 12 1 10
Accordingly , CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most differentiated programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. Amos .	76 2 1 37 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 30 1 44 6 0 1 12 6 1 48 7 6 36 0 1 38 1 42 1 2 56 0 1 10
And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its Larry King Live and Crossfire talk shows , which executives hope will keep people tuned in .	76 23 37 32 0 0 1 2 24 84 52 0 1 24 13 1 78 78 2 138 1 232 4 191 1 40 35 10

Until now , CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period .	59 1 2 1 20 21 6 0 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 10
But 70 % of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered , so CNN wants in .	76 0 1 12 6 0 1 33 11 1 28 24 38 1 123 13 1 123 2 6 1 27 2 104 1 28 24 10
Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to CNN 's other newcasts .	0 1 44 6 0 1 4 35 19 0 0 1 92 1 2 473 1 12 6 1 2 363 148 85 1 2 156 53 7 1 42 0 1 10
Some in the industry are skeptical .	23 12 6 1 28 24 10
I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , says Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report .	23 540 192 24 18 87 49 1 156 24 38 1 375 129 2 363 148 85 6 1 42 1 2 11 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 12 6 0 1 10
The evening news is also slated as CNN 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism .	6 0 1 14 35 22 7 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
In August , the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news specials at ABC .	59 1 2 6 1 11 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 10
She 's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly , in-depth segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories .	23 37 32 6 1 12 36 0 0 1 33 4 19 0 2 0 1 2 38 6 1 93 32 0 1 10
CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its branded programs , in the way 60 Minutes did so well for CBS .	0 1 44 6 1 40 38 52 1 4 19 1 38 6 0 1 2 38 6 1 0 1 34 67 35 38 1 10
That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces .	23 11 52 6 1 12 6 1 75 1 12 6 1 28 285 1 4 87 35 7 6 0 1 2 67 30 23 11 6 1 93 32 0 1 10
They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job .	23 20 35 21 6 1 18 5 1 7 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 65 66 1 28 53 7 6 1 10
The network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less-experienced work force .	6 1 42 1 20 35 60 67 38 0 1 2 45 7 6 0 0 1 10
CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks .	1 16 108 0 1 1 12 366 24 7 0 1 2 13 23 14 35 16 40 70 7 6 1 10
Says Mr. Mosettig : CNN is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything .	271 0 1 106 1 11 6 0 1 91 23 48 7 1 12 23 10
But to improve , they 've really got to make the investment in people .	76 18 79 2 23 20 35 94 18 19 6 1 12 1 10
In any case , cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN 's format .	59 6 1 2 0 1 11 1 18 19 6 1 12 1 42 1 10
They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage .	23 11 1 38 6 0 0 1 1 64 18 19 10
We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest , long-format programming , says Robert Stengel , senior vice president , programming , of Continental Cablevision Inc. , which holds a 2 % stake in Turner Broadcasting .	23 4 35 115 24 30 6 1 12 1 48 7 36 0 2 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 1 2 12 0 0 1 2 33 11 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 10
The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco , contrary to your Sept. 8 article Court Backs Texaco 's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late .	314 0 0 0 1 217 1 1 12 6 0 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 0 1 11 38 6 1 12 1 2 70 7 6 0 0 1 1 11 1 42 1 38 1 78 140 29 24 10
The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound .	6 0 1 12 0 1 22 7 6 1 65 66 1 4 35 19 1 12 124 6 1 4 35 154 18 74 40 10
In the Pennzoil\/Texaco litigation , the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound ; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 44 1 13 0 1 64 18 74 40 91 59 0 1 23 44 50 51 6 1 18 74 40 10
Admittedly , the principle in the cases is the same .	76 2 6 1 12 6 1 11 6 1 10
But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts .	76 6 1 12 6 0 1 72 16 48 7 6 1 10
And the facts , as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits , were different .	76 6 1 2 386 40 38 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 2 28 24 10
When you suggest otherwise , you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation .	39 23 34 35 2 23 11 6 1 12 1 13 11 6 1 12 1 10

Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches , leaving the transaction in limbo .	0 0 0 0 0 1 44 0 1 12 1 186 7 1 6 1 18 19 0 0 0 1 2 32 6 1 38 1 10
The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp. , whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements .	6 0 1 48 7 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 2 135 1 44 6 1 73 6 1 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 70 7 6 0 80 66 1 42 0 1 64 18 19 0 0 1 78 10

The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments .	6 1 42 1 65 66 6 1 2 32 0 0 1 38 1 78 2 4 74 22 46 24 30 52 6 1 13 6 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 11 6 1 18 19 1 10

Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law .	76 2 0 0 0 1 20 173 23 28 43 18 19 6 1 2 13 6 1 20 21 6 1 38 1 13 0 0 1 75 6 1 14 40 38 0 1 10
The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year .	6 1 12 6 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 57 32 0 1 12 1 13 32 6 1 42 0 0 1 2 33 11 86 0 9 67 35 10
The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch , best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team .	6 0 1 14 40 67 35 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 22 7 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 16 22 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch .	1 48 7 6 1 10
Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party , including FSLIC .	1 13 6 1 280 7 6 0 0 0 1 12 1 66 50 190 35 19 6 1 12 754 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 13 6 1 18 87 7 6 0 1 2 12 1 10

But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas .	76 6 1 44 23 11 0 0 1 12 1 13 6 1 13 11 6 1 70 7 0 0 1 12 1 10
Charles Haworth , a lawyer for Sunbelt , says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits , because Sunbelt 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ 2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988 .	0 1 2 6 1 12 1 2 44 23 64 18 19 6 1 81 1 229 6 0 1 18 19 6 1 2 30 1 42 1 11 6 1 38 0 86 0 9 30 0 1 11 23 38 1 123 10

The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system .	6 1 2 1 13 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 2 44 106 23 20 174 66 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 28 29 53 7 23 2 30 23 28 29 43 18 19 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 10

September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday .	1 42 0 1 12 0 1 65 66 1 16 34 2 13 6 1 12 0 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 48 7 6 0 1 42 0 1 10
After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer .	181 120 38 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 34 35 67 35 67 35 2 6 0 1 44 35 2 30 0 1 34 57 120 38 6 1 10
Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline .	39 6 1 2 33 14 40 30 6 0 1 34 2 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 1 44 23 4 19 6 1 38 6 1 42 1 10
Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped .	1 16 73 6 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 7 80 66 6 0 1 28 43 18 134 0 1 18 79 30 0 1 20 60 10
Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion .	16 32 6 80 66 1 12 6 1 28 43 18 5 6 1 155 32 1 2 6 0 1 65 35 66 0 1 34 67 35 38 1 2 38 86 0 9 10
That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .	6 1 34 38 1 12 6 36 0 1 12 1 2 13 44 50 51 35 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago .	23 44 6 0 1 2 230 7 6 1 12 6 1 2 11 6 80 66 50 885 113 18 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 10
But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers .	76 1 28 24 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 40 38 6 0 1 10
The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers .	6 0 36 0 1 28 24 38 23 2 13 118 28 29 24 65 66 59 1 13 1 2 6 0 0 1 16 34 38 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
But Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump .	76 0 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 2 73 0 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 7 1 12 6 0 1 10
I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , he said .	23 4 215 23 11 35 0 1 91 23 11 6 1 2 23 27 10
The core rate is not really out of line .	6 0 1 28 35 35 53 7 1 10
All year , energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods .	103 1 2 0 1 20 21 6 0 0 1 2 33 11 1 12 6 1 1 11 38 1 10
Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter , when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates .	1 16 20 60 70 7 6 0 1 69 78 2 391 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 235 6 1 120 38 0 0 1 10
Energy prices then plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months .	0 1 16 34 38 6 1 2 229 6 1 18 79 38 0 0 1 10
Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department said .	76 2 6 1 20 60 38 6 36 0 0 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 0 1 27 10
While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 .	109 29 29 24 84 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 23 11 35 6 0 1 12 6 36 0 1 12 23 12 1 10
Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August .	76 2 6 1 42 0 0 1 4 163 60 67 35 2 117 0 1 34 35 67 35 57 120 67 35 38 1 10
Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain .	6 1 82 0 1 18 115 29 24 38 6 1 78 2 327 6 0 1 12 1 24 10
Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated .	1 20 174 66 6 1 12 0 1 69 78 4 79 38 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 13 6 36 0 1 28 24 47 1 34 10
I think the resurgence -LCB- in inflation -RCB- is going to continue for a few months , said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm .	23 44 6 1 166 12 1 167 37 113 18 79 38 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 10
He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide .	23 44 6 1 4 79 67 35 2 207 66 0 1 28 29 24 35 10
But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an omen as the 0.9 % figure suggests .	76 0 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 65 66 0 1 42 1 11 35 52 52 6 1 75 6 36 0 1 34 10
If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , he explained .	39 23 11 6 1 35 2 6 1 14 40 38 0 13 0 0 1 2 69 93 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 13 0 1 2 23 27 10

Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase .	39 52 6 0 1 14 22 7 0 0 1 2 0 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 10
Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in September , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % .	1 12 0 1 34 81 0 0 1 38 1 2 30 1 12 0 0 1 34 67 35 10

Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in September to $ 32.82 billion .	76 2 6 0 0 1 65 66 0 1 34 67 35 38 1 38 86 0 9 10
But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , analysts said .	76 396 148 1 12 6 1 4 163 60 38 0 1 2 1 27 10
Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7 % after declining 0.6 % in August , while sales of building materials fell 1.8 % after rising 1.7 % .	1 12 0 0 1 34 67 35 57 120 67 35 38 1 2 30 1 12 0 1 34 67 35 57 120 67 35 10

CityFed Financial Corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $ 125 million to $ 150 million for the third quarter .	0 0 1 44 23 64 18 19 6 1 12 396 148 86 0 9 132 86 0 9 12 6 0 1 10
In the year-earlier period , CityFed had net income of $ 485,000 , but no per-share earnings .	59 6 0 1 2 1 11 0 1 12 86 9 2 13 6 0 1 10
CityFed 's president and chief executive officer , John Atherton , said the loss stems from several factors .	1 42 1 13 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 44 6 1 48 7 0 1 10
He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ 700 million from $ 516 million between June and September .	23 44 0 1 34 38 29 24 227 86 0 9 38 86 0 9 38 1 13 1 10
Approximately 85 % of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets .	36 0 1 12 6 1 48 7 0 0 0 0 1 10
Accordingly , CityFed estimated that it will provide between $ 85 million and $ 110 million for credit losses in the third quarter .	76 2 1 65 66 23 4 19 0 86 0 9 13 86 0 9 38 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
CityFed added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of City Federal Savings Bank , CityFed 's primary subsidiary , based in Somerset , N.J .	1 65 66 0 0 0 1 4 74 40 38 0 1 38 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 1 42 0 1 2 40 38 1 2 1 10
City Federal operates 105 banking offices in New Jersey and Florida .	0 1 11 0 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 10
Mr. Atherton said CityFed will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds .	0 1 44 1 4 35 5 6 1 12 0 0 1 7 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 207 66 0 1 73 23 7 52 1 10
That action , CityFed said , will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $ 30 million .	6 1 2 1 44 2 4 87 7 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 86 0 9 10
CityFed also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in New Jersey and Florida and , as a result , is taking a charge for discontinued operations .	1 16 44 23 64 18 19 6 0 0 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 13 2 85 6 1 2 37 32 6 1 12 0 1 10

He added , however : Depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of City Federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves , the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range .	23 44 2 35 106 122 7 6 1 12 0 0 1 45 7 0 1 13 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 69 12 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 4 16 19 6 1 10
CenTrust Savings Bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock , indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened .	0 0 1 44 0 0 1 82 23 18 19 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 207 66 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 20 60 10
In a statement , Miami-based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends .	59 6 1 2 0 1 44 6 1 11 6 1 42 0 1 13 0 1 12 6 0 1 57 32 6 1 12 6 1 10
Regulators also ordered CenTrust to stop buying back the preferred stock .	1 16 82 1 18 168 32 35 6 0 1 10
David L. Paul , chairman and chief executive officer , criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision , which issued the directive , saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons .	0 0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 11 6 1 2 214 23 28 24 13 161 7 0 1 10
He said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision .	23 44 6 1 4 154 18 134 1 18 19 6 1 10
The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health .	6 1 12 6 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 33 65 66 1 11 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 10
In March , regulators labeled CenTrust a troubled institution , largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses .	59 1 2 1 108 1 6 0 1 2 67 70 7 6 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 10
In the same month , the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 82 6 1 18 168 32 0 0 1 30 6 1 48 7 1 10
For the nine months ended June 30 , CenTrust had a net loss of $ 21.3 million , compared with year-earlier net income of $ 52.8 million .	59 6 0 1 40 8 9 2 1 11 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 2 70 7 0 0 1 12 86 0 9 10
CenTrust , which is Florida 's largest thrift , holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation .	1 2 33 11 1 42 0 1 2 11 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 10

Mr. Paul said only about $ 150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission .	0 1 44 0 0 86 0 9 12 6 0 1 11 0 1 22 7 6 1 13 0 1 10
The remainder , he said , are commercial loan participations , or private placements , that are n't filed with the SEC and do n't have a ready market .	6 1 2 23 44 2 11 0 0 1 2 13 0 1 2 33 14 35 22 7 6 1 13 4 35 19 6 0 1 10
CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds .	1 13 1 20 169 7 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market .	6 1 12 0 1 20 121 229 1 18 19 0 0 1 38 6 1 2 13 1 20 173 23 4 35 35 19 52 1 70 7 6 0 1 217 6 1 13 1 217 6 0 1 10
Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market .	1 20 164 29 53 7 0 1 13 0 0 1 78 78 38 1 12 6 0 0 0 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new , somber regulatory climate .	6 1 82 1 18 5 23 7 0 1 38 6 0 2 0 0 1 10
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , CenTrust common shares closed at $ 3 , down 12.5 cents .	59 0 0 0 0 1 76 2 0 0 1 48 7 86 9 2 38 0 1 10
In a statement Friday , Mr. Paul challenged the regulators ' decision , saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk-bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank .	59 6 1 76 2 0 1 11 6 1 42 1 2 214 6 1 42 0 1 13 0 0 1 20 151 16 40 38 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 10
He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds .	23 16 44 0 1 20 151 40 35 38 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
In the third quarter , for instance , CenTrust added $ 22.5 million to its general reserves .	59 6 0 1 2 59 1 2 1 73 86 0 9 7 6 0 1 10
Mr. Paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with approving CenTrust 's request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank , a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. based in Beverly Hills , Calif .	0 1 44 6 1 4 35 87 35 155 32 1 42 1 18 5 1 12 6 0 1 7 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 40 38 0 1 2 1 10
The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits , according to Mr. Paul .	6 0 1 11 6 1 12 1 42 1 18 467 23 7 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 33 48 35 7 0 1 38 1 2 70 7 0 1 10
Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in July , long before now .	0 1 13 0 1 20 21 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 33 14 40 38 1 2 67 38 1 10
Many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal .	1 73 6 1 7 6 80 66 1 28 53 7 6 1 10
Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution .	1 13 1 4 74 40 38 6 1 38 6 255 0 1 11 35 6 1 10
CenTrust , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion .	1 2 16 2 11 6 0 1 2 214 23 4 19 35 86 0 9 13 467 6 1 42 1 7 86 0 9 7 86 0 9 10
It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million as of Sept. 30 , thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards .	23 44 6 1 4 221 23 0 0 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 36 0 1 12 1 2 38 6 0 86 0 9 70 7 86 9 2 16 327 1 53 7 0 1 10
CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180 million .	1 44 6 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 38 0 86 0 9 10
Critics , however , say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds .	1 2 16 2 44 6 0 1 4 178 1 29 53 483 24 7 0 1 13 0 1 10
Mr. Paul counters that he intends to further pare the size of CenTrust by not renewing more than $ 1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due .	0 1 65 66 23 64 18 35 19 6 1 12 1 57 16 32 24 227 86 0 9 12 0 1 12 1 30 23 28 24 10
The thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds , and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate , as required under the new thrift law .	6 1 37 35 113 18 19 6 0 1 57 113 18 19 35 6 1 2 13 23 64 18 35 19 23 12 23 38 6 0 1 2 223 40 38 6 0 0 1 10
On a recent Saturday night , in the midst of West Germany 's most popular prime-time show , a contestant bet the host that she could name any of 100 different cheeses after just one nibble , while blindfolded .	59 6 0 0 1 2 59 6 1 12 0 1 42 36 0 0 1 2 6 1 308 6 1 66 23 4 19 23 12 0 0 1 38 36 0 1 2 223 40 10
The woman won the bet .	6 1 11 6 1 10
But perhaps even more remarkable , the three-hour-show , Wetten Dass -LRB- Make a Bet -RRB- , regularly wins the top slot in the country 's TV ratings , sometimes drawing as many as 50 % of West German households .	76 29 116 29 24 2 6 1 2 1 123 33 11 6 1 167 2 16 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 16 32 366 24 7 0 1 12 36 0 1 10
As the 1992 economic integration approaches , Europe 's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American cultural imperialism , threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as Dallas , Miami Vice and L.A.

While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry 's sluggish development .	39 23 12 6 1 65 66 1 11 6 1 12 1 2 76 1 65 66 6 1 64 18 87 7 6 0 0 1 42 0 1 10

Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are .	39 0 1 14 40 2 192 283 35 77 66 6 1 4 35 74 40 35 13 22 7 1 2 30 0 0 1 34 10
But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas .	76 36 0 1 14 22 7 6 1 2 35 2 6 1 33 11 0 0 13 0 1 2 57 32 0 1 10

The result is a new and huge appetite for programming .	6 1 11 6 0 13 0 1 12 1 10
But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the U.S. .	76 137 59 6 1 12 23 45 7 1 2 1 12 6 1 28 43 18 74 22 7 6 0 13 36 0 1 29 24 12 1 106 69 12 1 40 38 6 1 10

Already , British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system .	76 2 0 1 13 36 0 1 48 7 6 0 0 1 13 7 6 0 0 0 1 10
Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC , a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit .	137 137 76 23 44 23 4 19 6 0 1 18 19 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 40 38 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe 's defense industry .	6 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 12 52 0 1 12 0 0 13 0 0 0 1 106 37 32 1 38 0 1 42 0 1 10
Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals , including Matra S.A. in France and Britain 's General Electric Co. PLC .	16 40 38 0 0 0 1 505 19 6 0 0 1 2 12 0 1 12 1 13 1 42 0 0 0 1 10
But neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford , Conn.-based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces .	76 52 1 13 1 158 53 7 36 2 0 0 0 1 106 37 156 35 24 30 6 1 11 1 10
Yesterday , a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight , as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF .	76 2 6 1 24 84 1 65 66 6 1 4 19 6 0 1 2 38 1 12 6 0 1 33 4 79 38 0 1 13 1 10
Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra , Britain 's Dowty Group PLC , West Germany 's Daimler-Benz AG , and France 's Dassault group .	1 12 124 1 20 21 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 11 1 2 1 42 0 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 2 13 1 42 0 1 10
But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated .	76 192 283 661 1 346 1 13 6 0 1 162 319 18 79 2 6 1 27 10
GEC plans first to study Ferranti 's financial accounts , which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit , International Signal & Control Group , with which Ferranti merged last year .	1 64 35 18 19 1 42 0 1 2 138 1 16 232 11 86 0 9 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 12 124 1 34 67 35 10
Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators ; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry .	76 2 6 0 1 4 74 40 38 0 0 1 91 1 11 1 42 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 13 6 1 12 1 4 19 0 0 1 78 12 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 10
A consortium bid , however , would diminish GEC 's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials .	6 0 1 2 16 2 4 19 1 42 0 1 12 1 13 4 35 19 0 1 10
A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti : Competition is the name of the game , she said .	6 0 0 1 28 53 7 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 1 104 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 23 27 10

We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , a Matra official said Sunday .	23 11 23 18 5 7 6 1 2 33 4 35 19 23 2 6 0 1 27 185 10
The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the new environment in defense contracting .	6 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 44 2 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices .	59 52 1 13 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 20 169 7 1 12 36 0 0 1 91 13 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 2 20 151 40 38 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
The venture 's importance for Thomson is great .	6 1 42 1 12 1 28 24 10
Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans .	1 44 6 1 12 6 0 1 48 155 32 1 12 0 1 10
The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b .

In missiles , Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival , France 's Aerospatiale S.A. ; to better compete , Thomson officials say , they need a partnership .	59 1 2 1 1266 185 40 38 0 1 13 38 6 0 1 2 1 42 0 1 91 18 35 79 2 0 1 44 2 23 11 6 1 10
To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture , Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace .	18 19 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 1 4 5 6 0 1 7 0 1 10
Annual revenue of British Aerospace 's missile business is about # 950 million , a Thomson spokesman said .	0 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 11 0 86 0 9 2 6 0 1 27 10
British Aerospace 's chief missile products include its 17-year-old family of Rapier surface-to-air missiles .	0 1 42 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 10

Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two-step , 830 million Canadian-dollar -LRB- US$ 705.6 million -RRB- expansion of its system because Canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking .	0 0 0 1 44 23 4 19 6 0 0 2 88 36 0 662 527 0 9 167 1 12 6 1 30 1 42 1 12 0 1 37 120 10
Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate .	1 2 1 42 0 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 2 44 0 0 1 65 66 0 0 1 4 19 36 36 0 1 92 1 38 1 2 0 1 3 84 6 0 1 10
Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level .	0 0 1 11 0 0 0 1 92 1 38 1 42 0 1 2 36 0 1 209 6 0 1 10
The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc .	6 1 12 0 1 18 19 1 37 120 2 13 0 0 1 28 35 29 24 2 104 0 1 11 6 1 38 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 13 0 1 12 1 42 1 2 0 0 1 10
Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s .	0 1 44 1 12 1 42 1 28 126 36 0 1 38 1 13 14 17 18 79 35 2 327 1 24 38 52 6 1 10
There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , he said .	50 150 21 6 1 12 6 1 230 7 6 0 1 2 23 27 10
Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .	1 12 1 42 0 13 0 1 44 6 1 12 0 1 28 24 47 23 34 38 1 2 13 20 21 6 0 13 0 1 35 10
The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group .	6 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 28 179 0 1 46 6 1 3 2 13 6 1 12 0 0 1 28 126 1 12 23 2 369 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 217 1 2 6 0 1 10
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada .	0 1 44 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 11 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 2 0 1 12 0 1 10
Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude .	1 11 36 0 1 12 6 1 40 38 0 1 2 13 36 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 48 7 0 1 10
Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal .	0 1 12 6 0 1 138 1 11 38 6 1 14 40 38 1 42 1 2 135 0 1 34 38 1 38 0 0 13 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 12 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 10
Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation .	1 42 0 0 1 12 6 1 11 36 0 1 92 1 2 13 36 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 6 36 0 0 0 0 1 10
That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico .	23 73 1 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 12 0 1 2 1 13 1 10
Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East .	0 1 44 1 42 0 0 1 2 230 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 4 143 19 0 1 12 1 12 1 2 52 6 0 1 10
It 's very much a growing concern .	23 11 67 35 6 0 1 10
But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , he said .	76 39 23 28 24 2 23 64 18 87 7 23 2 23 27 10
Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude , however , since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada 's falling output .	0 1 65 66 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 4 35 38 23 19 0 1 12 0 1 2 35 2 30 0 1 14 40 38 6 1 38 1 42 0 1 10
Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 .	59 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 33 4 163 21 0 1 2 1 64 18 5 0 1 92 1 12 0 1 7 6 1 2 70 7 6 0 1 12 1 10
The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day .	6 1 16 11 6 1 12 36 0 1 92 1 10
Inland Steel Industries Inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50 % from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs .	0 0 0 1 64 18 77 66 0 1 34 24 304 67 35 38 6 0 1 38 6 1 12 0 0 1 13 0 1 10
In the second quarter , the steelmaker had net income of $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share , including a pretax charge of $ 17 million related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of $ 1.11 billion .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 11 0 1 12 86 0 9 13 86 9 92 1 2 38 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 24 84 6 1 12 6 1 2 38 1 12 86 0 9 10
The company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter , compared with the second quarter .	6 1 44 0 0 1 13 0 1 40 38 0 0 1 11 1 38 0 1 38 6 0 1 2 70 7 6 0 1 10
At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract .	59 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 14 40 38 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 13 0 1 2 102 102 13 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T. Ryerson & Son unit .	6 0 1 14 40 38 0 1 13 0 1 24 84 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 10
The company said it is beginning to see some shipping-rate improvements in both the intergrated-steel and steel-service-center segments , which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter .	6 1 44 23 37 113 18 19 6 0 1 38 52 6 0 13 0 1 2 90 4 87 7 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Inland said its third-quarter results will be announced later this week .	1 44 6 0 1 4 74 40 67 81 1 10
In the year-earlier third quarter , when the industry was in the midst of a boom , the company had net of $ 61 million , or $ 1.70 a share , on sales of $ 1.02 billion .	59 6 0 0 1 2 75 6 1 48 7 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 11 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 2 38 1 12 86 0 9 10
Predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately .	32 6 0 1 12 0 1 20 21 6 0 1 35 10
Take Microsoft Corp. , the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether .	19 0 1 2 92 0 1 112 0 0 1 13 16 11 6 0 1 10
In July , the company stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10 % in 1990 , a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of years past .	59 1 2 6 1 11 0 1 38 6 80 66 1 12 6 0 0 1 78 4 19 36 0 1 38 1 2 6 0 1 196 22 7 6 0 1 12 1 24 10
Investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing -- reacted by selling the company 's stock , which lost $ 3.25 that day to close at $ 52 in national over-the-counter trading .	1 211 111 23 7 6 80 66 6 0 0 1 48 7 6 1 106 34 57 32 6 1 42 1 2 33 82 86 9 81 1 18 87 7 86 9 38 0 0 1 10
But that was all of three months ago .	76 23 28 0 650 0 1 3 10
Last week , Microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 to increase 34 % .	137 76 2 1 44 23 82 1 12 6 0 1 40 8 9 18 79 67 35 10
The announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ 6.50 to close at $ 75.50 a share .	6 1 82 6 1 42 1 18 154 8 9 18 87 7 86 9 92 1 10
Microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms .	1 42 0 1 11 0 1 12 6 1 32 1 45 7 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
It 's hard to know what to expect at this point , said Peter Rogers , an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co .	192 193 24 18 19 651 18 19 38 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
The industry defies characterization .	6 1 11 1 10

Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc. , a computer retailer .	6 0 1 34 38 0 1 2 6 0 1 10
In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a share .	59 1 2 6 1 65 66 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 13 1 20 169 49 0 1 24 141 120 38 6 0 1 40 8 9 38 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 92 1 10
This month , however , Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 had n't met expectations .	103 1 2 76 2 1 308 1 66 1 12 6 0 1 40 8 9 20 35 21 1 10

Companies will continue to war over standards .	1 4 154 18 79 38 1 10
In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays .	59 0 1 2 6 1 12 1 37 32 0 0 1 2 33 11 1 33 11 6 1 40 38 1 13 1 10
Until recently , Adobe had a lock on the market for image software , but last month Apple , Adobe 's biggest customer , and Microsoft rebelled .	109 24 2 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 2 13 137 76 1 2 1 42 0 1 2 13 1 34 10
Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe 's approach , and analysts say they are likely to carry IBM , the biggest seller of personal computers , along with them .	76 6 0 1 37 45 7 6 1 12 1 42 1 2 13 1 44 23 28 43 18 178 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 53 7 23 10
The short-term outlook for Adobe 's business , however , appears strong .	6 0 1 12 1 42 1 2 16 2 28 24 10

Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason , the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights -LRB- 9:30-10 p.m. EDT -RRB- .	76 76 23 4 79 38 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 120 38 6 0 0 1 120 38 1 78 38 0 0 1 167 10
Not only is Mr. Mason the star of Chicken Soup , he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to Duck Soup , and he 's currently a man in hot water .	137 523 1268 0 1 6 1 12 0 1 2 23 11 35 6 1 12 6 0 1 120 70 7 0 1 2 13 23 11 35 6 1 12 0 1 10
Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company .	24 2 59 0 1 2 145 6 1 12 0 1 42 1 2 40 35 38 6 0 1 30 23 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 13 35 38 1 30 23 13 6 1 11 1 10
Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically .	0 1 65 66 0 0 1 28 53 7 1 2 104 23 11 0 1 35 10
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically .	23 65 66 0 0 1 28 24 38 0 1 2 104 23 2 16 2 11 0 1 35 10
He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa .	23 65 66 1 20 139 1 7 0 1 38 6 1 140 29 24 10
Of course , Mr. Mason did not use neutral language .	59 1 2 0 1 4 35 19 0 1 10
As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular .	59 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 0 1 13 6 0 1 2 0 1 16 48 7 6 1 10
He said Jews were sick with complexes ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , a fancy shvartze with a mustache .	23 44 1 28 53 7 1 91 13 23 108 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ?	39 0 1 20 195 36 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 244 6 1 115 29 29 24 10
It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .	23 16 34 2 30 1 13 1 12 6 1 24 84 0 1 42 1 20 94 18 87 7 6 1 12 6 1 13 6 80 66 23 11 0 1 10
In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .	59 1 2 23 12 0 1 42 1 20 174 66 6 1 12 0 1 11 35 6 1 12 1 10
For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is like a dinosaur .	59 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 65 66 0 1 48 7 6 1 10
People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck .	1 37 16 32 6 1 75 23 14 40 10
These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as Polish jokes ; and the type that is double-edged , aiming inward as well as outward .	6 1 64 18 87 7 6 1 12 0 1 33 48 155 32 6 1 2 69 12 0 1 91 13 6 1 33 28 24 2 120 35 102 102 13 35 10
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .	6 1 16 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 13 23 14 40 38 6 1 13 1 38 6 1 13 0 1 38 6 1 93 32 6 0 13 0 1 230 7 23 10
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .	59 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 4 5 52 6 1 13 6 1 7 1 10
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .	76 40 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 23 11 6 0 1 12 1 10
Why constructive ?	1015 24 10
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict .	39 59 52 6 0 1 237 1 13 1 250 120 2 23 28 53 7 0 1 39 23 4 87 7 1 93 32 1 13 32 6 1 12 1 12 1 270
That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .	23 162 55 192 193 24 18 1221 0 0 1 2 85 0 1 13 16 2 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer .	39 0 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 67 38 6 0 1 2 76 1 4 35 79 35 38 52 1 30 0 1 14 17 18 79 10
The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?	6 1 586 2 39 0 1 16 34 166 30 76 23 34 167 2 13 39 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 28 24 2 76 76 76 420 244 23 19 57 32 35 1 10
Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .	143 35 19 6 0 1 2 30 23 64 18 19 6 1 33 2 85 6 0 1 18 19 23 13 19 23 2 11 1 35 117 23 11 1 10
It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in Cheers ; children vs. adults in The Cosby Show .	192 383 24 66 6 0 1 4 134 0 1 18 79 153 1 12 0 1 12 1 91 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 10
But these are not the differences that make headlines .	76 23 11 35 6 1 33 11 1 10
In Chicken Soup , Mr. Mason plays Jackie , a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie -LRB- Lynn Redgrave -RRB- , an Irish widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother -LRB- Rita Karin -RRB- and her brother Michael -LRB- Brandon Maggart -RRB- .	59 0 1 2 0 1 11 1 2 6 0 1 32 1 12 0 1 167 2 6 0 1 13 1 12 1 2 38 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 167 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 167 10
It 's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants .	192 383 126 1 66 6 0 1 11 1 10
At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do Jackie and Maddie .	59 1 2 23 16 34 38 0 1 2 297 206 1 13 1 10
It could n't be more obvious that Chicken Soup is being made from an old recipe .	192 283 35 556 29 24 66 0 1 37 182 40 38 6 0 1 10
And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam .	95 6 0 1 808 79 30 6 1 12 1 48 7 6 0 1 13 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 10
Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of Abie 's Irish Rose made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .	122 7 6 1 2 6 0 13 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 136 6 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 13 0 1 289 24 66 6 1 2 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 38 6 80 66 6 1 20 21 6 0 1 10
And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called Bridget Loves Bernie , whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney .	76 23 20 164 24 2 223 40 38 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 330 1 11 1 2 135 0 1 65 66 23 34 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 10
Clearly , the question with Chicken Soup is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .	76 2 6 1 12 0 1 162 35 55 6 1 4 79 35 2 13 55 23 4 79 38 23 10
So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .	137 76 2 6 1 20 21 1 13 29 24 10
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues .	1 12 6 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 69 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 18 87 7 0 1 10
To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them .	59 6 1 2 6 1 34 30 6 1 64 18 5 23 7 0 1 57 32 23 10
For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .	59 1 2 1 11 1 67 30 23 11 6 0 0 1 2 13 30 23 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 322 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .	116 29 24 145 6 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 42 0 1 10
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .	6 0 1 12 6 1 34 38 6 1 13 6 1 1269 1270 161 7 6 1 167 2 75 0 1 34 38 6 0 1 13 37 111 35 6 0 0 1 7 0 1 102 102 13 7 23 10
But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .	76 137 76 2 6 1 11 1 30 6 1 2 85 6 1 2 28 53 155 32 0 1 42 1 12 1 12 0 1 10
I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz .	23 37 35 364 299 6 1 168 723 24 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer .	6 1 2 85 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 4 154 18 79 35 2 16 79 35 2 30 23 4 79 10
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about caring for other people that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America .	76 23 37 364 299 23 168 229 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 38 6 1 93 45 7 0 1 33 4 115 24 38 6 1 12 0 1 10
At your age , Jackie , you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame .	59 6 1 2 76 2 23 64 18 77 66 23 4 35 19 1 57 32 35 6 1 10
The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a 60-year history of calm , right up through Friday .	6 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 1 2 70 208 7 1 10
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement Friday that the stock-market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy .	0 0 0 1 65 38 6 1 35 66 6 0 1 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 10
The economy , he added , remains well-balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth .	6 1 2 23 44 2 28 24 13 6 1 48 7 0 0 1 10
Sound familiar ?	115 24 10
Here 's what Ronald Reagan said after the 1987 crash : The underlying economy remains sound .	24 145 119 0 1 11 38 6 0 1 104 6 0 1 28 24 10
There is nothing wrong with the economy ... all the indices are up .	50 51 23 24 84 6 1 106 52 6 1 28 24 10

The former president and chief executive , Eric W. Markrud , resigned in June .	6 0 1 13 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 34 38 1 10
The Senate 's decision to approve a bare-bones deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year .	6 1 42 1 18 19 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 16 436 24 6 1 93 32 6 0 0 1 81 1 10
Late Friday night , the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit .	137 137 76 2 6 1 64 35 18 19 6 0 125 0 9 1 33 20 151 22 7 1 12 1 33 4 163 60 2 102 13 60 2 6 0 0 1 10
Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases .	1 16 11 6 1 18 19 80 66 23 28 53 7 0 0 1 13 0 1 10
We 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill , said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser -LRB- D. , Tenn . -RRB- .	23 37 111 6 0 1 35 7 6 1 93 32 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 10
But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut .	76 0 1 12 6 0 1 65 66 0 1 4 35 168 120 38 1 90 4 19 23 12 6 1 33 20 151 40 35 2 12 6 0 0 1 10
In addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision .	59 1 2 6 0 0 1 16 40 38 6 1 11 6 0 1 10
House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while .	0 1 28 43 18 79 38 1 13 79 38 6 1 10
No one can predict exactly what will happen on the House side , said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , Kan . -RRB- .	6 1 4 194 76 129 4 79 38 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 10
But , he added , I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year .	76 2 23 44 2 23 44 1 13 1 4 154 35 18 19 0 1 81 1 10
White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill .	0 0 0 0 0 1 308 1 35 66 6 1 4 35 154 18 19 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , he said .	23 4 35 5 23 7 6 1 18 19 0 1 2 23 27 10
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- said in an interview , If that 's the signal that comes from the White House , that will help a great deal .	0 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 44 38 6 1 2 39 23 11 6 1 33 34 38 6 0 1 2 23 4 79 81 0 1 10
The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year .	6 1 42 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 13 4 178 1 12 6 0 0 1 29 24 81 1 10
Opponents of the cut are playing hardball .	1 12 6 1 37 32 1 10
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said he was confident that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut .	0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 44 23 28 266 66 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 4 35 19 6 0 0 1 10
And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation originates , said there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year .	76 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 2 75 0 1 34 2 44 50 51 35 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 33 4 19 6 0 0 1 81 1 10
One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit .	0 0 1 18 19 6 0 0 1 2 13 52 0 0 1 22 7 6 0 1 2 11 6 1 18 19 6 0 0 1 10
Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month .	52 1 4 74 40 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress .	6 0 1 14 152 24 38 6 1 18 19 1 38 1 10
Because the legislation has n't been completed , President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law .	39 6 1 20 35 151 40 2 0 1 64 38 1 78 18 19 0 0 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 10
Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill .	1 65 66 6 1 18 19 6 1 4 134 6 1 18 87 7 6 0 1 10
The House appears reluctant to join the senators .	6 1 28 43 18 19 6 1 10
A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions .	6 1 162 55 0 1 28 43 18 87 7 6 0 1 42 1 18 19 0 0 1 10
Although I am encouraged by the Senate action , said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee , it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate .	39 23 14 40 38 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 12 6 0 1 13 0 1 2 192 331 24 55 6 0 1 4 74 40 38 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks .	6 0 1 120 38 6 1 11 119 0 1 11 10
He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut .	23 20 121 32 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill .	76 0 1 11 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 13 19 6 0 1 17 18 19 6 0 1 38 6 1 2 104 23 34 70 7 6 0 1 10
The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the House-passed bill .	6 0 1 14 22 7 0 36 2 36 0 2 1 2 6 1 12 361 14 40 38 6 0 1 10

Also missing from the Senate bill is the House 's repeal of a law , called Section 89 , that compels companies to give rank-and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives .	16 45 7 6 0 1 438 6 1 42 1 12 6 1 2 15 1 123 2 33 82 1 18 221 0 1 0 0 1 12 36 0 1 10
One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts .	0 0 1 33 48 35 7 6 0 1 13 14 40 35 30 23 11 1 11 6 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 12 6 0 0 1 18 19 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
Mr. Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon .	0 1 44 23 44 6 1 4 19 6 1 35 10
To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare .	59 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 11 6 1 40 38 6 0 1 33 4 163 21 6 0 0 1 12 1 10

Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator .	0 1 65 66 6 1 11 1 12 6 1 10
It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken .	23 34 2 1 44 2 30 50 51 6 1 104 6 0 1 14 40 10
The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced .	6 1 16 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 33 4 163 21 6 0 1 12 124 0 1 175 6 0 0 1 40 10

It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting , which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden .	23 72 16 11 6 1 33 4 163 21 118 48 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 33 14 17 38 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 10

Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director Darman , who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill .	0 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 2 33 592 198 6 0 1 18 74 22 7 6 1 2 20 151 40 30 0 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 13 87 7 0 1 67 81 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 0 1 10

Friday 's big drop , she says , was not a crash .	1 42 0 1 2 23 44 2 11 35 6 1 10
This was an October massacre like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 .	23 11 6 0 1 12 23 33 34 38 1 13 1 10
Now , as in those two years , her stock market indicators are positive .	76 2 122 7 6 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 28 24 10
So she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained .	76 23 44 6 1 4 115 24 13 24 10
Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12 % down , she says .	6 1 11 0 228 0 1 13 11 6 1 0 1 26 2 23 27 10
This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned .	23 11 52 6 0 1 2 67 35 117 23 14 40 10

A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it .	36 36 0 1 12 1 28 53 7 23 10
In 1987 , such selling contributed to a snowball effect .	59 1 2 52 1 48 7 6 0 1 10
Today could even be an up day , Mr. Davis says , if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading .	1 4 35 19 6 0 1 2 0 1 44 2 30 0 0 1 64 18 87 7 0 1 10
Over the next several months , though , he says things look bad .	59 6 0 0 1 2 76 2 23 44 1 28 24 10
I think the market will be heading down into November , he says .	23 44 6 1 4 168 120 35 38 1 2 23 27 10

Unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year .	59 1 2 0 1 20 121 120 81 1 10
Unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong .	59 1 2 6 1 20 164 24 10

The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity .	6 1 12 0 1 13 1 20 21 6 1 12 0 1 38 6 1 12 1 13 139 6 1 33 11 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 7 0 1 12 1 102 13 1 10
This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable .	23 20 16 170 1 24 13 6 1 29 24 10
Nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely .	76 2 23 44 6 1 4 35 115 24 10

Yes , he did .	76 2 23 34 10
As I watched him on C-Span , I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights , which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings .	39 23 11 23 38 1 2 23 44 23 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 138 23 73 7 6 1 12 6 1 10

He used about 56 words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights .	23 11 36 0 1 32 6 1 42 0 1 10
Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth .	76 2 59 6 0 1 2 23 11 24 25 0 1 111 1 7 6 1 57 32 6 1 10
He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary .	23 11 6 1 12 0 1 38 0 1 12 0 1 10
As your editorial rightly pointed out , Samuel Pierce , former HUD secretary , and Lance Wilson , Mr. Pierce 's former aide , are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment .	39 6 1 16 34 35 2 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 13 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 2 37 35 182 152 53 7 1 57 32 6 0 1 10

Right now they 're pursuing evidence .	137 76 23 37 32 1 10

How was that practice referred to when I was in school ?	243 384 6 1 172 7 30 23 48 7 1 10
Ah , yes , something called a Star Chamber .	431 2 185 2 23 15 6 0 1 10
Of course , Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change .	59 1 2 0 1 20 174 66 6 1 16 11 1 38 0 1 10
No doubt that 's partially true .	6 255 23 28 29 24 10
Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true .	23 138 0 1 11 38 6 1 28 29 24 10

it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense .	23 11 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 10
The problem , which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. Lantos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\/judicial body .	6 1 2 138 6 1 72 16 11 35 38 6 1 12 1 2 11 52 6 1 12 0 1 2 33 85 23 11 35 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 13 6 1 12 1 18 5 23 7 6 0 1 10

I do not by any means defend HUD management .	23 4 35 38 6 1 19 0 1 10
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and , yes , maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate .	76 23 44 6 1 12 0 1 33 20 151 40 11 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 13 1 75 6 1 166 13 2 52 2 52 1 167 12 1 4 35 79 10

Raymond Weber	0 1
Parsippany , N.J .	1 2 1 10
I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings .	23 48 7 6 1 12 0 1 75 23 4 35 19 6 0 1 38 0 0 1 33 11 6 0 0 1 12 1 38 0 1 10
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself .	6 0 1 65 38 0 1 66 6 1 4 74 17 2 38 6 0 1 2 18 19 6 1 12 23 10
This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify .	6 1 12 1 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 33 64 35 18 79 10
Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to take the Fifth .	76 2 59 6 0 1 2 6 1 4 35 87 7 6 1 42 1 18 79 566 244 6 1 74 17 18 19 6 1 38 6 1 2 16 229 23 18 19 6 1 10
The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only .	6 1 2 16 2 20 151 17 38 1 12 6 0 1 18 19 6 1 38 0 1 123 10
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause .	6 0 1 13 6 1 20 16 174 66 6 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 30 6 1 14 40 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
Baxter v. Palmingiano , 425 U.S. 308 -LRB- 1976 -RRB- .	1 12 1 2 0 1 123 12 1 167 10
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .	76 2 59 6 0 1 2 6 1 4 74 22 7 6 1 2 23 4 74 17 18 79 13 19 6 1 2 13 6 1 12 6 1 4 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 23 12 6 0 1 10
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .	23 4 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 67 30 23 11 6 0 80 13 0 80 66 6 1 4 5 23 7 0 1 10
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .	229 6 1 18 19 6 1 38 6 0 1 14 16 40 38 6 0 1 18 154 18 79 30 23 42 1 11 23 38 6 0 1 2 13 346 6 1 12 6 0 1 4 74 16 22 7 23 38 6 0 0 1 10
Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify .	126 6 1 12 52 1 2 6 1 4 134 6 1 18 79 10
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .	76 2 39 0 1 11 6 1 38 6 0 1 2 67 57 16 32 0 1 12 0 1 2 23 4 77 66 23 11 6 0 2 0 80 66 6 1 4 74 22 7 23 38 6 0 0 1 10
The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .	6 1 2 1 13 6 0 1 11 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 13 18 87 7 0 1 42 0 80 66 6 1 4 143 5 23 7 6 1 10
Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination .	32 6 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 4 35 19 6 0 0 1 12 1 10

It was Friday the 13th , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points .	23 11 52 6 1 2 13 6 0 1 34 96 67 35 10
Just a coincidence ?	52 6 1 10
Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ?	76 343 1 12 1 12 6 1 78 106 24 10
In academia , a so-called Friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors .	59 1 2 6 0 36 314 1 1 20 151 40 35 13 40 35 38 0 1 10
Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez , professors of finance at the University of Miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th .	0 1 13 0 1 2 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 11 80 66 6 1 14 40 38 52 6 1 10
But their study , which spanned the 1962-85 period , has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data .	76 6 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 2 20 35 151 17 18 74 40 38 6 0 1 12 1 10
In the '70s , the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you-know-what .	59 6 1 2 6 1 11 1 67 35 68 6 1 38 52 6 1 10
But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to Yale Hirsch , a collector of stock market lore .	76 6 1 64 18 19 6 1 2 52 6 1 2 38 1 2 70 7 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices .	6 1 65 66 6 1 704 132 1 12 6 0 1 11 36 36 0 1 106 24 171 84 1 158 24 2 33 64 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 10
On the only other Friday the 13th this year , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points .	59 52 52 52 52 6 1 92 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 34 96 67 35 10
Professor Kolb says the original study , titled Friday the 13th , Part VII , was published tongue-in-cheek .	0 1 44 6 0 1 2 15 52 6 1 2 0 1 2 14 40 35 10
In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity .	59 6 0 1 2 23 65 66 6 1 12 6 0 1 13 1 42 0 1 4 163 21 6 1 2 35 2 38 1 42 0 1 10
reminiscent of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered .	956 7 23 12 6 0 1 106 66 39 0 1 34 13 0 1 34 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 28 24 10
We could n't get dealers to answer their phones , said Robert King , senior vice president of OTC trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta .	23 4 35 134 1 18 19 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 10
It was -LCB- like -RCB- the Friday before Black Monday two years ago .	23 48 166 7 167 6 1 12 0 1 0 1 107 10
Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges .	39 0 0 1 11 6 1 13 105 2 0 1 34 67 35 68 23 12 6 36 0 13 0 1 10
Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3 % , to 467.29 .	76 2 6 0 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 13 6 1 123 123 2 120 35 2 13 67 35 2 38 1 10
Ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading .	0 1 12 6 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 12 1 10
By comparison , the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled 5.8 % Friday and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell 4 % .	59 1 2 6 0 0 0 0 1 34 67 35 35 13 6 0 0 0 1 34 67 35 10
On Oct. 16 , 1987 , the Nasdaq Composite fell 16.18 points , or 3.8 % , followed by its devastating 46.12-point , or 11 % slide , three days later .	59 86 9 2 123 2 6 0 1 34 67 35 2 13 67 35 2 40 38 6 0 0 2 13 36 0 1 2 0 1 26 10
Nasdaq volume Friday totaled 167.7 million shares , which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year .	0 1 16 11 36 0 1 2 90 11 52 6 0 210 1 69 12 6 1 10
The single-day record of 288 million shares was set on Oct. 21 ,	6 0 1 12 36 0 1 14 40 38 86 9 2
There was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved , said E.E. Buzzy Geduld , president of Herzog , Heine , Geduld , a New York company that makes markets in thousands of OTC issues .	50 51 35 6 1 12 1 30 192 193 29 24 18 191 1 40 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 12 0 2 0 2 1 2 6 0 0 1 33 11 1 38 1 12 0 1 10
Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors .	1 12 6 1 12 0 0 1 34 38 0 1 102 13 0 1 10
Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades .	0 1 12 1 13 1 28 43 18 77 66 23 44 6 1 34 67 38 1 42 1 18 19 6 1 12 1 2 102 13 6 0 1 18 168 32 1 10
The subject is a sore one for Nasdaq and its market-making companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash .	6 1 11 6 0 1 38 1 13 6 0 1 2 33 14 16 40 0 1 26 38 1 12 1 33 4 35 19 6 1 13 79 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , declared : It was the last hour of trading on a Friday .	0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 44 106 23 11 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 10
There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots .	50 957 36 0 1 120 13 36 0 1 120 18 134 0 1 18 115 29 53 7 1 10
It was n't intentional , we were all busy .	23 28 35 24 2 23 28 35 24 10
James Tarantino , head of OTC trading at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco , said , It was just like two years ago .	0 1 2 1 12 1 78 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 44 2 23 48 161 46 0 1 3 10
Everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time .	23 37 113 18 19 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
Jeremiah Mullins , the OTC trading chief at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York , said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading .	0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 65 35 66 6 1 11 6 1 23 11 38 6 1 12 1 10
But , he added , you can only take one call at a time .	76 2 23 44 2 23 4 35 19 0 1 38 6 1 10
Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur .	0 1 11 1 12 1 38 1 18 19 0 1 30 1 34 10
On days like Friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to .	59 1 12 1 2 23 44 23 4 5 1 7 1 30 6 1 24 28 43 236 10
When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast .	39 1 28 29 24 2 1 34 35 13 35 10
Two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices .	0 1 234 2 22 7 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 78 37 32 1 2 32 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
On Friday , some market makers were selling again , traders said .	59 1 2 6 0 1 37 120 35 2 1 27 10
But , with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand .	76 2 347 1 120 38 0 1 38 6 1 2 1 20 21 0 0 1 38 1 10
Mr. Tarantino of Hambrecht & Quist said some prices fell without trades taking place , as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares .	0 1 12 0 0 1 44 6 1 34 31 1 32 1 2 30 0 1 37 32 6 1 12 124 23 4 19 1 10
Everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid , he said .	23 37 32 23 24 42 1 2 23 27 10
So , while OTC companies incurred losses on Friday , trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in 1987 .	76 2 39 1 78 11 1 38 1 2 0 1 44 6 1 28 35 29 24 47 23 34 38 1 10
Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit .	0 1 234 23 37 32 0 1 13 23 11 6 0 1 10
I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , said Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey .	23 4 35 87 7 23 32 0 1 35 2 56 0 1 12 1 10
Tony Cecin , head of equity trading at Piper , Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis , said that Piper Jaffray actually made money on Friday .	0 1 2 1 12 0 1 12 0 2 0 0 1 12 1 2 65 66 0 1 16 11 1 38 1 10
It helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago , he said .	192 1057 66 6 1 28 6 1 3 35 30 23 34 0 1 26 2 23 27 10
Joseph Hardiman , president of the National Association of Securities Dealers , which oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an emergency .	0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 11 6 0 0 0 1 2 65 66 59 6 1 12 1 2 23 16 108 6 1 6 1 10
The pace of trading was orderly , he said .	6 1 12 1 28 24 2 23 27 10
Nasdaq 's Small Order Execution System worked beautifully , as did the automated system for larger trades , according to Mr. Hardiman .	1 42 0 0 0 1 34 35 2 297 206 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 70 7 0 1 10
Nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence .	76 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 16 4 19 0 1 42 1 10
In the past , the OTC market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation .	59 6 1 2 6 0 1 48 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and OTC market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent .	39 1 42 0 1 20 35 60 38 0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 44 6 1 4 35 115 24 10
But they are worried .	76 23 28 24 10
We were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , lamented Mr. Mullins of Dean Witter .	23 37 35 113 18 19 6 1 42 1 35 2 56 0 1 12 0 1 10
More troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support the OTC market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the October 1987 crash .	29 24 145 6 80 66 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 35 19 6 1 12 0 1 6 0 1 37 113 18 19 38 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Mr. Cecin of Piper Jaffray says some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears .	0 1 12 0 1 44 6 1 12 0 0 1 4 19 0 1 10
It wo n't take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors , he says .	192 283 35 134 1 24 18 178 6 1 53 7 0 1 2 23 27 10
The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers .	6 1 85 1 34 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 38 0 13 0 0 1 2 102 102 13 0 1 13 0 1 10
But grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares , compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago .	76 0 1 44 6 0 1 16 34 97 0 1 38 0 1 2 70 7 1 12 0 1 69 78 0 1 89 10
Shearson 's Mr. DaPuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain-hunt .	1 42 0 1 44 0 1 16 11 1 35 13 16 34 18 79 10
Institutional investors , which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter , were calmer .	0 1 2 33 20 121 32 1 38 0 1 18 19 35 0 1 40 38 6 0 1 2 28 24 10
We had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic , Mr. DaPuzzo said .	23 11 6 0 1 12 1 12 1 2 13 52 36 0 1 2 0 1 27 10
If they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf .	39 23 4 35 79 2 23 12 23 73 6 1 35 7 6 1 10
In addition , he said , some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some OTC stocks whose prices were beaten down .	59 1 2 23 44 2 6 0 0 1 11 1 18 19 6 0 1 135 1 14 40 35 10
In addition , Mr. DaPuzzo said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index sent occasional waves through the market .	59 1 2 0 1 44 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 42 0 1 11 0 1 38 6 1 10
Nasdaq 's biggest stocks were hammered .	1 42 0 1 14 40 10
The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or 19.76 , to 449.33 .	6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 34 67 35 2 13 35 2 38 1 10
The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2 % , or 9.31 , to 462.98 .	6 0 0 1 12 0 0 13 0 1 34 67 35 2 13 35 2 38 1 10
The OTC market has only a handful of takeover-related stocks .	6 0 1 11 52 6 1 12 0 1 10
But they fell sharply .	76 23 34 35 10
McCaw Cellular Communications , for instance , has offered to buy LIN Broadcasting as well as Metromedia 's New York City cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain McCaw properties to Contel Cellular .	0 0 1 2 85 1 2 20 94 18 19 0 1 102 102 13 1 42 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 13 85 6 0 1 2 5 0 0 1 7 0 1 10
McCaw lost 8 % , or 3 1\/2 , to 40 .	1 11 0 1 2 13 0 1 2 38 1 10
LIN Broadcasting , dropped 5 1\/2 , or 5 % , to 107 1\/2 .	0 1 2 34 67 35 2 13 67 35 2 38 0 1 10
The turnover in both issues was roughly normal .	6 1 12 6 1 28 29 24 10
On a day when negative takeover-related news did n't sit well with investors , Commercial Intertech , a maker of engineered metal parts , said Haas & Partners advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported $ 27.50-a-share bid to buy the company .	59 6 1 75 0 0 1 4 35 79 35 38 1 2 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 44 0 0 1 308 23 66 23 4 35 154 18 19 6 36 0 125 9 1 18 19 6 1 10
Commercial Intertech plummeted 6 to 26 .	0 1 34 35 38 1 10
The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday .	6 1 12 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 1 16 34 35 10
On the OTC market , First Executive , a big buyer of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid 2 to 12 1\/4 .	59 6 0 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 2 0 1 2 34 35 38 0 1 10
Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 ; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1\/8 to 19 1\/2 ; the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off 1\/4 to 10 1\/4 ; MCI Communications slipped 2 1\/4 to 43 1\/2 ; Apple Computer fell 3 to 45 3\/4 and Nike dropped 2 1\/4 to 66 3\/4 .	59 0 0 1 2 1 2 34 67 35 38 0 1 91 0 1 11 0 1 38 0 1 91 6 0 0 1 12 1 28 126 1 38 0 1 91 0 1 34 67 35 38 0 1 91 0 1 34 35 38 0 1 13 1 34 67 35 38 0 1 10

And they plan to buy more today .	76 23 64 18 19 1 35 10
Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash : Buying at the bottom pays off .	76 13 76 2 0 0 0 1 64 18 168 32 6 0 1 57 32 6 1 23 11 38 6 0 0 1 75 120 38 6 1 34 35 10
To be sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today .	18 115 24 2 0 1 4 19 35 6 1 38 6 1 30 1 28 29 24 35 10
They could still panic and bail out of the market .	23 4 35 79 13 87 35 7 6 1 10
But their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse .	76 6 0 1 65 66 23 4 35 19 1 30 1 28 29 24 10
Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , said John W. Rogers , president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc. , which manages $ 1.1 billion of stocks .	137 76 2 23 14 40 57 120 35 13 32 1 30 6 1 11 6 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 2 33 11 86 0 9 12 1 10

He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further .	23 64 18 19 6 1 30 6 1 34 35 10
Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday 's rout shaved $ 40 million from the value of the $ 752 million Janus Fund he oversees .	0 0 0 0 1 14 35 40 30 1 42 1 73 86 0 9 7 6 1 12 6 125 0 9 0 1 23 11 10

Then he jumped into the market :	76 23 34 38 6 1 106

I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn .	23 37 120 38 6 1 38 1 167 13 23 4 168 120 35 30 23 44 23 37 32 0 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 78 2 78 10
There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash .	50 51 6 1 38 6 0 1 38 6 1 10
Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock .	59 0 1 2 33 4 74 17 18 19 1 30 1 64 18 19 1 2 0 1 69 12 0 1 13 0 1 4 154 18 19 35 0 1 57 32 1 10
Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone .	137 76 2 23 11 0 1 2 30 1 20 94 18 19 6 0 0 1 2 111 0 86 0 9 7 0 1 24 10
If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc .	39 23 34 38 6 1 2 23 34 67 67 35 38 6 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 10

The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif .	6 0 1 308 0 1 66 23 64 18 19 0 1 2 13 66 23 4 35 87 7 0 1 2 24 13 24 2 56 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 69 78 112 0 1 2 1 10
Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it , he said , so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline .	23 33 34 35 166 68 1 167 11 23 2 23 44 2 185 23 44 23 4 19 6 0 1 38 0 1 38 6 1 12 1 42 1 10
Stocks , as measured by the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , have been stellar performers this year , rising 27.97 % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends .	1 2 386 40 38 6 0 0 1 42 0 1 2 20 21 0 1 81 1 2 120 67 35 38 1 42 1 2 38 1 10
Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades .	52 0 1 78 136 1 126 24 25 0 1 2 69 12 6 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 10
You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , said James D. Awad , president of New York-based BMI Capital Corp .	23 4 79 35 67 35 13 16 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 12 36 0 0 0 1 10
Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days .	0 1 2 16 2 65 66 6 1 4 79 35 67 13 67 35 38 6 0 0 1 10
It can happen before you can turn around .	23 4 79 30 23 4 115 24 10
He said he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading .	23 44 23 11 0 1 12 1 2 12 6 1 12 0 1 13 6 1 12 0 0 1 10
The only thing you do n't have , he said , is the portfolio insurance phenomenon overlaid on the rest .	6 0 1 23 4 35 19 2 23 44 2 11 6 0 0 1 40 38 6 1 10
Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash .	0 0 1 20 21 6 0 0 0 1 2 33 14 16 17 18 163 21 6 0 1 10
Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts .	52 52 1 2 6 1 14 17 18 19 6 1 12 0 0 1 13 19 6 0 1 57 32 1 12 0 0 1 10
In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected .	59 6 0 1 2 6 86 0 9 12 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 4 35 79 2 30 0 1 34 13 0 13 0 1 28 24 10
Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers said .	137 59 0 1 2 0 1 28 24 35 2 0 1 27 10
Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands .	0 1 2 135 36 0 0 0 1 20 139 0 1 12 6 125 0 9 0 1 7 1 38 0 1 2 44 23 14 40 38 0 0 1 35 229 23 18 5 1 7 6 1 10
We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything , said Mr. Weisman , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers .	23 11 1 12 0 0 1 718 23 55 23 64 18 5 1 7 23 2 56 0 1 2 33 2 53 7 6 1 12 1 40 35 35 2 11 6 1 10
Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again , trapping more investors .	0 1 44 1 4 154 18 79 38 6 0 0 1 57 120 35 2 32 0 1 10
I think it will be a rigor mortis rally , he said .	23 44 23 4 19 6 0 0 1 2 23 27 10
Meanwhile , Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally .	76 2 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 135 0 1 20 139 23 7 1 12 6 0 1 10
Especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this year 's market climb .	29 24 145 6 0 1 2 33 20 151 40 38 6 1 42 0 1 10
The shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price .	6 1 11 0 1 2 113 18 79 57 32 23 35 38 6 0 1 10
The nation 's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers , Palo Alto , Calif. , which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point .	6 1 42 0 0 1 11 0 1 2 69 78 2 78 2 33 65 67 35 66 6 0 1 20 21 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 70 7 6 1 10
All that now has changed .	6 1 16 20 60 10
We 're ahead for the year because of Friday , said the firm 's Kurt Feshbach .	23 28 53 7 6 1 70 7 1 2 56 6 1 42 0 1 10
We 're not making a killing , but we had a good day .	23 37 35 32 6 1 2 13 23 11 6 0 1 10
Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the U.S. Attorney 's office in Baltimore .	1 13 0 0 0 0 1 44 6 1 20 139 35 1 38 6 0 1 32 0 0 1 7 6 0 1 42 1 12 1 10
Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens , N.Y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes .	52 1 13 23 12 6 36 36 2 0 2 1 42 1 13 1 20 151 22 7 6 1 10
Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests .	1 11 1 18 19 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 65 66 23 73 6 0 0 0 1 7 6 1 38 1 10
Mr. Nesbit also said the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic .	0 1 16 44 6 1 20 195 0 0 1 18 19 38 6 0 1 6 0 0 1 10
But so far the company has n't complied with that request , the spokesman said .	76 137 76 6 1 20 35 169 7 6 1 2 6 1 27 10
Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , Mr. Nesbit said .	1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 13 6 0 1 42 1 12 6 1 13 0 0 1 2 16 64 18 19 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 67 67 70 7 0 1 2 52 1 2 0 1 27 10
Bolar , of Copiague , N.Y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug .	1 2 12 1 2 1 2 16 11 6 0 1 12 6 78 36 0 13 36 0 1 12 6 1 10
The FDA has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin .	6 1 20 173 23 11 1 23 11 38 6 1 207 66 1 73 6 0 1 7 6 1 18 19 0 1 18 19 0 1 12 1 10
Bolar has denied that it switched the brand-name product for its own in such testing .	1 20 174 66 23 73 6 0 1 7 6 1 38 52 1 10
The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands .	6 36 0 0 0 0 0 1 64 18 19 6 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 10
The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders .	6 0 0 1 4 19 6 1 12 0 0 1 30 6 1 1 64 18 19 4 19 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 13 1 237 1 111 0 0 1 7 0 1 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 10
Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , ASKO 's Dutch lawyers noted .	122 7 1 0 0 1 12 6 1 20 151 40 2 140 24 2 1 42 0 1 27 10
Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense , ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV .	703 6 1 19 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 2 1 4 35 134 6 1 18 19 52 6 0 1 16 40 38 0 0 1 10
ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders .	1 44 6 0 0 0 1 11 35 0 1 18 5 0 1 7 6 0 1 13 16 19 6 1 13 0 1 12 1 13 0 1 10
Speaking through its Dutch lawyers , ASKO also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in Ahold .	120 38 6 0 1 2 1 16 44 23 11 6 36 0 1 12 1 10
It was previously thought ASKO held a 13.6 % stake that was accumulated since July .	192 358 35 330 1 11 6 36 0 1 33 14 40 38 1 10
A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue .	6 1 12 1 44 6 1 28 53 7 6 0 1 13 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
He termed ASKO 's legal actions as unproductive to international cooperation among European retailers .	23 73 1 42 0 1 46 53 7 0 1 12 0 1 10
Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican , but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush 's economic policy-making .	0 0 0 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 2 13 59 0 1 23 11 0 0 1 38 0 1 42 0 1 10
There are some very significant issues out there , such as the fiscal deficit , the trade deficit , our relations with Japan , that have to be the subject of major initiatives , he said in an interview .	50 51 6 36 0 1 69 78 2 69 12 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 1 2 33 64 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 2 23 27 153 6 1 10
I 'd like to see that initiative , and I have n't .	23 4 154 18 19 6 1 2 13 23 34 35 10
There is n't a big shot , an agenda .	50 51 35 6 0 1 2 6 1 10
A few hours later , the stock market dropped 190 points .	6 0 1 234 2 6 0 1 34 67 35 10
Politicians tried to finger each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street 's woes .	1 64 18 5 23 24 7 6 1 2 30 0 1 65 66 1 28 29 53 7 0 1 42 1 10

The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill .	6 1 28 24 30 1 13 6 1 20 94 18 19 1 12 6 0 1 10
We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- said yesterday on NBC News 's Meet the Press .	23 16 4 35 19 0 1 18 154 18 19 6 1 13 19 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 27 185 153 0 1 42 11 6 1 10
-- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy .	106 59 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 20 151 40 38 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been resisting .	6 1 20 121 113 18 19 6 1 35 91 6 1 20 121 120 10
One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , said Lawrence Kudlow , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's This Week .	1 12 6 1 33 64 18 19 23 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 153 1 42 0 1 10
-- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers .	106 6 1 20 21 35 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
Last month , Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines .	137 76 2 0 0 0 1 82 0 1 18 19 6 1 40 38 0 0 0 1 10
But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision .	76 23 20 35 60 38 1 12 6 1 13 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC .	76 23 20 164 53 309 55 6 1 4 19 6 1 12 0 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop .	6 1 44 1 12 1 42 0 1 11 0 1 75 1 12 6 0 0 1 34 35 12 6 1 33 11 6 0 1 10
In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash .	59 0 1 2 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 28 29 53 7 23 12 1 123 42 0 1 10
Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold .	76 2 109 24 2 6 0 1 48 7 1 13 0 0 1 48 7 1 93 32 1 10
The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve .	6 1 14 40 38 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 30 59 6 1 23 48 7 0 0 1 69 12 6 0 1 10
And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous .	76 1 12 0 1 22 7 1 106 67 38 6 0 0 1 13 0 1 69 12 6 0 1 106 37 327 1 24 10
The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .	6 0 1 11 6 0 1 13 0 1 38 6 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 45 7 6 0 1 18 19 6 1 38 24 227 86 0 9 203 76 293 6 1 16 34 38 0 86 0 9 38 6 1 10
But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year .	76 2 59 0 1 12 6 1 92 1 2 6 0 1 4 35 115 24 81 1 10
Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented .	1 13 0 1 65 66 1 42 1 2 85 23 2 28 35 43 18 19 6 1 70 7 6 1 18 154 18 19 6 0 1 33 4 115 29 24 13 29 24 84 0 1 42 0 1 2 33 16 14 35 16 40 10
One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble .	1 12 6 0 1 75 0 1 28 35 43 18 79 35 65 66 2 39 23 34 38 1 2 6 1 13 6 1 4 19 6 0 0 1 10
Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , Rep. Panetta said yesterday in an interview .	23 44 23 37 45 7 6 1 12 1 2 66 23 37 45 7 6 1 2 0 1 27 185 153 6 1 10
That did not happen .	23 4 35 79 10
They learned they could survive it without much problem .	23 44 23 4 19 23 38 0 1 10
But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy .	76 0 1 16 48 7 0 1 2 33 44 6 0 1 92 1 37 113 18 134 6 1 13 1 18 19 6 0 210 1 12 0 1 10
In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around .	59 6 1 2 50 190 19 1 12 1 18 79 35 10
There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- .	50 51 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 75 13 50 190 79 106 75 6 1 20 35 164 29 24 57 32 6 1 13 75 1 20 164 43 18 19 119 6 1 82 23 18 19 2 56 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 10
Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight .	76 2 23 16 4 134 1 12 1 42 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 33 20 60 38 1 13 0 0 0 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .	0 1 28 29 24 38 0 1 42 80 66 6 0 1 11 1 12 1 42 0 1 13 6 1 93 111 23 7 6 0 1 10
There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said yesterday on CBS News 's Face the Nation .	50 51 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 1 69 78 30 6 1 16 4 35 79 35 38 6 1 42 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 27 185 153 0 1 42 11 6 1 10
During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds .	59 0 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 2 50 51 80 66 0 1 13 6 1 48 7 1 10
At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it .	59 6 0 1 75 0 1 37 32 6 1 18 5 0 1 7 6 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 308 1 66 192 390 6 1 42 1 18 19 23 10
When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it .	39 6 1 14 40 18 5 0 1 7 6 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 11 23 10
Asked if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : The adminstration will have to speak for itself .	317 55 6 1 34 2 23 16 44 106 6 1 4 154 18 79 38 23 10
Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest .	1 42 0 1 4 19 1 12 32 6 0 13 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 33 14 35 17 18 79 38 1 12 6 1 10
Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit .	0 1 11 6 80 66 6 1 4 19 6 1 12 6 1 2 33 85 1 64 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 33 4 163 21 6 0 0 1 10
The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman -LRB- R. , N.H . -RRB- . said yesterday .	6 1 11 6 0 80 66 23 28 53 7 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 18 19 23 592 198 6 1 12 1 18 5 6 1 7 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10 167 10 27 185 10
The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion .	6 0 0 1 12 1 13 1 2 135 1 162 55 6 0 1 14 40 2 65 66 6 0 0 1 4 19 6 0 0 1 38 86 0 9 2 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 42 1 12 86 0 9 10
Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : We 're getting very close to the margins here .	0 1 65 66 1 42 1 4 35 115 43 18 19 0 0 1 2 13 44 106 23 37 156 29 53 7 6 1 35 10
No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday 's drop in the stock market .	6 1 12 1 28 43 18 19 6 1 93 32 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 10
But some players were quick to seize the moment .	76 6 1 28 43 18 19 6 1 10
Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains .	39 6 1 20 60 38 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 11 6 1 111 6 1 12 0 1 7 6 0 1 18 19 1 12 0 1 10
Investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , he said .	1 2 33 20 121 32 1 38 1 12 6 36 0 1 18 79 2 14 40 2 23 27 10
There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .	50 150 21 0 0 1 40 18 19 6 0 0 1 2 0 1 44 38 6 0 1 2 13 23 44 23 11 1 123 12 23 12 6 1 10

Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend , but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market .	0 1 11 6 0 0 1 38 1 38 6 1 2 13 1 64 18 168 32 6 0 1 13 44 23 14 22 155 32 35 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
I 'm not losing faith in the market , said Boston lawyer Christopher Sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm .	23 37 35 32 1 12 6 1 2 56 0 0 0 1 104 23 44 6 1 34 38 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 10
But he 's not so sure about everyone else .	76 23 28 35 29 53 7 23 24 10
I think on Monday the small -LRB- investors -RRB- are going to panic and sell , predicted Mr. Sullivan , whose investments include AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and several mutual funds .	23 44 59 1 6 1 132 1 167 37 113 18 79 13 79 2 56 0 1 2 135 1 11 0 1 42 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 10

If I sell now , I 'll take a big loss .	39 23 34 35 2 23 4 19 6 0 1 10
Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n't flee the market in 1987 .	23 11 6 1 33 20 151 40 30 23 4 35 19 6 1 38 1 10
Oh , I bet it 'll be up 50 points on Monday , said Lucy Crump , a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington , Ky .	76 2 23 44 23 4 115 126 0 1 38 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10
Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash , but no one got discouraged , and we gained that back -- and more .	0 1 44 6 0 0 1 42 1 11 0 1 12 6 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 13 6 1 14 40 2 13 23 11 23 35 38 13 1 10

Some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the U.S. were attending when the market started to slide Friday .	36 0 1 32 0 1 12 52 6 1 37 120 30 6 1 64 18 79 35 10
But Robert Showalter , an official of the association , said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned .	76 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 2 44 6 0 1 13 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 14 40 10

Not everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday 's slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines .	52 23 37 120 67 35 2 185 2 13 1 48 7 6 0 1 12 118 14 16 22 7 6 1 12 1 42 1 2 1 12 1 18 19 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 10
Marc Perkins , a Tampa , Fla. , investment banker , said the market drop is one of a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending .	0 1 2 6 36 2 0 2 0 1 2 44 6 0 1 11 1 12 6 0 1 12 80 66 6 0 0 1 37 120 10
There 's no question that there 's a general distaste for leverage among lenders .	50 51 6 80 66 50 51 6 0 1 12 1 38 1 10
Mr. Perkins believes , however , that the market could be stabilized if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of $ 275 a share .	0 1 65 2 35 2 66 6 1 4 74 40 30 0 0 0 1 34 35 70 7 6 0 1 38 6 1 12 86 9 92 1 10

I have this feeling that it 's built on sand , she says , that the market rises but there 's no foundation to it .	23 11 6 255 39 23 14 40 38 1 2 23 34 2 104 6 1 34 13 50 51 6 1 12 23 10

Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school , I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid .	137 122 7 1 12 6 1 13 137 39 23 16 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 18 79 38 1 2 23 44 38 6 1 23 64 18 115 6 1 824 24 10

The crowded field for notebook-sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded .	6 0 1 12 0 1 28 43 18 115 6 1 824 24 10
Compaq Computer Corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially Zenith Electronics Corp. , the current market leader , and on a swarm of promising start-ups .	0 0 1 42 0 1 78 12 6 0 1 14 17 18 5 0 1 7 1 12 6 1 2 52 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 13 7 6 1 12 0 1 10
Compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market .	1 42 1 12 1 11 6 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad , and two others have introduced even smaller palmtops .	0 1 16 20 1278 6 0 1 15 6 1 2 13 0 1 20 21 36 0 1 10
But those machines are still considered novelties , with keyboards only a munchkin could love and screens to match .	76 6 1 14 35 15 1 2 38 1 52 6 1 4 19 13 1 18 79 10
Compaq 's notebooks , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines .	1 42 1 2 85 1 2 4 19 6 1 12 6 0 1 16 18 87 7 1 40 38 36 0 1 10
Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000 .	1 44 23 28 24 13 11 0 1 12 23 24 12 6 1 12 6 1 106 13 23 14 22 35 7 86 9 12 86 9 10
All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases .	23 12 23 34 38 6 1 33 11 36 0 1 13 34 35 38 0 1 10
In recent months , Compaq 's competition , including Zenith , Toshiba Corp. , Tandy Corp. and NEC Corp. all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly .	59 0 1 2 1 42 1 2 12 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 16 20 21 1 33 11 52 6 1 13 33 14 15 1 140 29 24 10
One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name .	0 1 2 207 66 0 0 1 28 36 0 1 3 2 73 1 7 6 1 10
This is n't quite a notebook -- I call it a phonebook , he says .	23 11 35 35 6 1 104 23 108 23 6 1 2 23 27 10
That ca n't be said of the $ 2,400 notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by GRiD Systems Corp. , a unit of Tandy .	23 4 35 74 22 7 6 125 9 0 1 40 6 0 1 26 38 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 1 10
Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to read block printing .	122 7 6 1 2 23 11 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 13 6 1 18 19 0 1 10
At 4 1\/2 pounds , it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth .	59 36 0 1 2 23 4 74 72 16 40 2 13 23 16 11 35 6 1 12 0 1 33 282 1 79 10
Palmtops are n't far behind .	1 28 35 29 24 10
Atari Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , weighs less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs .	0 1 42 1 2 40 38 1 0 1 26 13 38 6 1 38 0 1 2 11 24 41 6 1 2 11 6 0 86 9 13 48 7 0 0 1 2 13 11 6 1 18 19 6 1 13 0 0 1 10
Some critics , however , say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory .	6 1 2 16 2 215 6 1 18 19 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 10
Poquet Computer Corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run Lotus 1-2-3 and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five times as much .	0 0 1 2 16 2 20 21 6 88 36 0 1 33 4 19 0 1 13 0 0 0 1 2 13 11 36 0 0 1 10
At stake is what Mike Swavely , Compaq 's president of North America operations , calls the Holy Grail of the computer industry -- the search for a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere .	7 1 101 119 0 1 2 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 2 108 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 157 24 23 4 19 23 35 10
The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be .	6 1 28 157 24 2 23 162 35 531 24 23 4 115 10
I 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is , says Tom Humphries , director of marketing for GRiD .	23 20 345 6 1 12 1 113 18 19 35 1 18 194 35 531 24 23 28 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 1 12 1 10
Whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter .	39 23 11 86 0 9 13 86 0 9 2 23 11 35 1 10
It 's huge .	23 28 24 10
Consider the growth of portables , which now comprise 12 % of all personal computer sales .	19 6 1 12 1 2 33 16 11 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Laptops -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year .	1 12 52 23 12 0 1 106 20 21 6 0 0 0 1 2 31 1 120 81 1 10
Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises .	45 7 6 1 2 16 2 20 60 38 6 1 12 1 10
Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory .	327 1 24 16 37 32 1 10
It also has precluded use of the faster , more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines .	23 16 20 21 1 12 6 0 2 36 0 1 40 38 0 1 12 0 1 10
Size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays .	0 13 0 1 16 20 21 0 1 10
The competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times .	6 0 1 4 115 29 24 38 1 10
A Poquet spokesman , for example , criticizes the Atari Portfolio because it requires three batteries while the Poquet needs only two .	6 0 1 2 85 1 2 11 6 0 1 30 23 11 0 1 30 6 1 11 0 1 10
Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers , who argue that they 're too small -- a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups , admits Gerry Purdy , director of marketing .	6 1 14 40 38 0 1 2 33 65 66 23 28 29 24 30 6 1 1 16 11 38 0 1 2 11 0 1 2 1 12 1 10
Poquet , trying to avoid the gadget label , responded with the tag line , The Poquet PC -- a Very Big Computer .	1 2 113 18 19 6 0 1 2 34 38 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 36 0 1 10
Despite the sniping , few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises .	59 6 1 2 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 33 4 35 19 1 10
Toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq .	59 6 1 2 1 44 6 0 1 4 19 1 38 0 1 12 0 2 0 13 0 1 10
Compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like Dynabook Inc. , which introduced in June a computer that , like Compaq 's , uses an Intel 286 microprocessor and has a hard disk drive .	1 42 0 1 14 15 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 11 38 1 6 1 33 2 85 0 1 2 11 6 0 0 1 13 11 6 0 0 1 10
But the Dynabook product is twice as heavy and costs more than Compaq 's .	76 6 0 1 28 29 29 24 13 11 1 12 0 1 10
Compaq 's announcement also spells trouble for Zenith , which last year had 28 % of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines Bull , the French government-owned computer maker .	1 42 1 16 11 1 38 1 2 33 72 16 11 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 16 64 18 5 6 0 1 7 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 10
Zenith holders will vote in December on the proposed $ 635 million sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to Zenith 's share and sales .	0 1 4 87 38 1 7 6 0 125 0 9 1 2 6 1 33 4 79 30 23 14 22 7 1 42 1 13 1 10
Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith 's market share .	1 37 35 111 1 7 1 42 0 1 10
Rod Canion , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes pointedly that Zenith 's $ 2,000 MinisPort uses an unconventional two-inch floppy disk , whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1\/2-inch disk .	0 1 2 1 42 1 13 0 0 1 2 65 35 66 1 42 125 9 1 11 6 0 0 0 1 2 30 1 42 0 1 11 6 36 0 36 0 1 10
John P. Frank , president of Zenith Data Systems , simply shrugs off such criticism , noting that 3 1\/2-inch floppies were also unconventional when they first replaced five-inch disks .	0 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 1 2 16 11 35 52 1 2 207 66 36 0 1 28 35 24 30 23 16 11 0 1 10
We do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , he argues .	23 4 35 341 7 23 155 16 32 6 1 2 23 260 7 23 7 6 0 1 2 23 27 10
Analysts do n't see it that way .	1 4 35 19 23 81 1 10
I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , says Gene Talsky , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc .	23 4 35 77 66 23 4 87 7 23 33 4 35 583 23 23 11 1 38 1 13 6 1 38 23 24 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
The problem Compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them .	6 1 1 37 113 18 19 65 66 23 4 35 115 43 18 19 1 12 23 10
Compaq 's machines include the 3 1\/2-inch floppy disk drive , a backlit screen that is only 1\/4-inch thick and an internal expansion slot for a modem -- in other words , almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine .	1 42 1 11 6 36 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 33 28 35 29 24 13 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 106 12 0 1 2 69 534 92 1 112 6 0 0 1 10
Others undoubtedly will follow , but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition .	1 16 4 79 2 13 0 1 44 1 11 296 148 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Toshiba 's line of portables , for example , features the T-1000 , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the T-1600 , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size .	1 42 1 12 1 2 85 1 2 11 6 1 2 33 48 7 6 0 0 1 13 28 29 24 13 11 0 1 2 13 6 1 2 33 16 11 6 0 1 2 13 33 11 0 1 12 1 13 11 62 52 6 1 10
A third model , marketed in Japan , may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990 , but by then , analysts say , Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players .	6 0 1 2 40 38 1 2 4 19 6 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 13 59 1 2 1 44 2 1 4 163 139 23 7 1 12 0 0 1 10

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it would n't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15 % of Jaguar shares .	6 0 0 0 1 308 1 67 35 66 23 4 35 19 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 10

Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , on margin -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop .	1 33 11 1 38 0 1 30 23 34 2 153 1 106 4 115 29 24 84 1 38 1 42 0 1 10
That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .	23 397 346 6 1 4 134 23 18 19 6 1 13 19 35 0 1 18 19 6 1 32 6 1 10
In October 1987 , these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market .	59 1 123 2 6 0 1 14 17 18 163 169 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value .	76 2 6 0 1 34 30 6 1 12 6 1 34 38 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
If the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities .	39 6 1 4 35 19 35 6 0 1 18 19 6 1 2 6 0 1 4 168 32 6 1 10

Merrill Lynch & Co. officials do n't expect -LCB- margin calls -RCB- to be as big a factor as in 1987 because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman said .	0 0 0 0 1 4 35 134 166 0 1 167 18 19 62 52 6 1 78 112 1 30 0 0 1 37 32 1 38 1 2 6 1 27 10
Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp. , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm , said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers .	0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 36 0 0 0 1 2 44 23 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 10
He said Schwab had increased margin requirements so customers have more of a cushion .	23 44 1 20 21 0 1 104 1 11 1 12 6 1 10
He added : We learned a lesson in 1987 about volatility .	23 44 106 23 11 6 1 38 1 38 1 10
Avis Inc. , following rival Hertz Corp. 's lead , said it is backing out of frequent-flier programs with three airlines .	0 1 2 32 0 0 1 42 1 2 44 23 37 120 70 7 0 1 12 0 1 10
The Garden City , N.Y. , car-rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp.

Industry estimates put Avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million .	0 1 73 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 1 7 0 86 0 9 13 86 0 9 10
A spokesman for Avis would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total .	6 1 12 1 4 35 19 6 1 13 44 6 0 1 182 40 48 7 0 1 12 23 12 6 1 10
Budget Rent a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car Rental Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit .	52 52 6 0 1 2 12 1 2 13 0 0 0 0 1 2 12 1 2 16 44 23 11 6 1 18 19 1 10
In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get car-rental discounts .	59 1 2 1 44 23 11 6 1 93 156 53 7 6 1 2 12 124 1 11 0 1 13 1 4 19 0 1 10
I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs , said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning .	23 4 35 194 55 6 1 12 1 13 1 4 35 19 1 42 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 42 0 1 2 0 1 10
Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements .	1 13 1 11 1 12 6 0 1 12 124 1 11 1 10
National also participates in the Northwest frequent-flier program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit .	1 16 48 7 6 0 0 1 70 7 0 0 1 2 12 1 13 0 0 1 42 0 1 10
A month ago , Hertz , of Park Ridge , N.J. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta , America West and Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines , and that pacts with American Airlines , UAL Inc 's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended ... sometime after Dec. 31 .	6 1 234 2 1 2 12 0 1 2 1 2 65 66 23 4 19 6 0 1 38 0 1 38 1 2 0 1 13 0 0 1 42 0 1 13 0 1 2 13 66 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 13 1 16 4 74 40 106 70 7 86 9 10
At the time , Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $ 15 million .	59 6 1 2 1 44 6 0 1 12 6 1 48 7 86 0 9 13 66 6 1 12 0 1 11 86 0 9 10
Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high .	1 13 1 2 16 2 44 6 1 28 29 24 10
Budget said its frequent-flier costs are substantially below Avis 's level .	1 44 6 0 1 48 161 7 1 42 1 10
Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing , said , The proliferation and costs attached to -LCB- frequent-flier programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value .	0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 1 2 44 2 6 1 13 1 22 7 166 0 1 167 20 16 21 6 1 10

They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , he said .	23 20 121 113 18 19 6 1 35 2 13 23 11 6 36 0 1 18 19 23 2 23 27 10

CBS insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the late-night talk show format since 1972 .	1 44 6 1 11 35 6 1 12 6 1 2 33 11 6 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 12 1 10
I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August .	23 11 6 1 93 146 23 6 36 0 1 13 278 23 79 67 35 11 6 0 1 12 23 2 56 0 1 2 33 14 15 0 1 12 0 0 1 38 1 10
This will raise the energy level of the show .	23 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
CBS will continue to program action-adventure shows to follow the Sajak hour .	1 4 154 18 19 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 10

The show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by A.C.

Tandem Computers Inc. , preparing to fight with International Business Machines Corp. for a piece of the mainframe business , said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .	0 0 1 2 113 18 79 38 0 0 0 1 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 44 23 64 18 19 0 1 13 1 12 6 0 0 1 40 8 9 10
Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ 450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .	1 44 23 64 18 19 1 12 0 86 0 9 13 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 92 1 10
The results , which are in line with analysts ' estimates , reflect a continued improvement in our U.S. business , said James Treybig , Tandem 's chief executive officer .	6 1 2 33 48 7 1 12 1 42 1 2 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 42 0 0 1 10
In the year-earlier period , Tandem reported net income of $ 30.1 million , or 31 cents a share , on revenue of $ 383.9 million .	59 6 0 1 2 1 11 0 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 0 1 92 1 2 12 1 12 86 0 9 10
Tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week .	1 64 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 67 35 10
Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino , Calif. , company will report revenue of $ 430 million to $ 460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .	1 20 174 66 6 36 2 0 2 1 4 19 1 12 86 0 9 132 86 0 9 13 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 92 1 10
Commenting on the results for the quarter , Mr. Treybig said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as a surprise to him , noting that sales in every region of the U.S. exceeded our plan .	45 7 6 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 44 6 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 48 7 6 1 12 23 2 207 66 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 11 6 1 10
The company 's U.S. performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers , he said .	6 1 42 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 23 27 10
Tandem makes fault-tolerant computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock exchanges , networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems .	1 11 0 1 12 1 12 0 0 1 106 33 11 0 1 2 1 12 0 1 13 0 0 0 1 10
Tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever , which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers .	76 6 1 14 17 18 19 6 36 0 1 78 2 33 85 6 0 1 4 19 23 38 0 1 12 1 12 0 1 10
Tandem 's new high-end computer is called Cyclone .	1 42 0 0 1 14 15 1 10
Prices for the machine , which can come in various configurations , are $ 2 million to $ 10 million .	1 12 6 1 2 33 4 87 7 0 1 2 11 86 0 9 132 86 0 9 10
Analysts expect the new computer to wrest a hefty slice of business away from IBM , the longtime leader in mainframes .	1 82 6 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 1 70 7 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 10
We believe they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from IBM over the next few years , said George Weiss , an analyst at the Gartner group .	23 44 23 4 19 36 0 228 36 0 1 38 1 38 6 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
That will spur Tandem 's growth .	23 4 19 1 42 1 10
I 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20 % next year , said John Levinson , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs & Co .	23 4 115 24 30 6 1 34 38 24 25 0 1 67 35 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 2 0 0 1 10
IBM is expected to respond to Tandem 's Cyclone by discounting its own mainframes , which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from Tandem .	1 14 17 18 87 7 1 42 1 57 32 905 0 1 23 471 1 232 11 62 62 52 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 10
Obviously IBM can give bigger discounts to users immediately , said Mr. Weiss .	76 1 4 5 0 1 7 1 35 2 56 0 1 10
But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue 's machines .	76 0 1 162 55 23 4 115 43 18 5 1 42 0 1 155 32 35 23 12 6 1 138 0 1 16 73 7 0 1 42 1 10
The answer is n't price reductions , but new systems , he said .	6 1 11 35 0 1 2 13 0 1 2 23 27 10
Nevertheless , Tandem faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as complementary to IBM 's mainframes .	76 2 1 11 6 1 12 1 2 6 1 207 66 1 16 73 6 1 42 1 46 53 7 1 42 1 10
Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion , insisting that Tandem 's new machines are n't replacements for IBM 's mainframes .	0 0 1 28 43 18 19 6 1 2 207 66 1 42 0 1 11 35 1 12 1 42 1 10
We 're after a little bigger niche , he said .	23 48 7 6 0 210 1 2 23 27 10
Do n't jump yet .	143 35 79 35 10
The stock market 's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy .	6 0 1 42 1 4 154 35 18 19 0 1 12 6 1 10
In one wild hour of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for weeks .	59 0 0 1 12 1 2 6 1 64 18 19 119 6 0 1 20 121 113 18 19 2 35 2 38 1 10
It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar .	23 37 229 6 0 1 18 19 6 1 12 1 13 23 11 6 1 70 7 6 36 0 1 10
The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business -- indeed , the entire economy .	6 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 1 12 6 1 4 19 0 1 106 78 2 92 0 1 10
This may sound strangely optimistic .	23 4 115 29 24 10
After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy .	59 23 2 109 6 0 1 3 2 6 0 1 14 22 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
When it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed .	39 23 34 35 2 59 6 1 2 6 1 34 10
That has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable .	23 20 60 2 67 30 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 20 164 29 24 10
The 1987 crash was a false alarm however you view it , says University of Chicago economist Victor Zarnowitz .	6 0 1 434 6 0 1 55 23 11 23 2 56 0 71 1 0 0 1 10
The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation .	6 1 28 29 53 7 6 1 12 6 1 10
Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy .	6 1 4 35 74 22 7 0 0 1 2 566 244 23 154 18 19 0 1 12 6 1 10
The market today has a life of its own , John Akers , chairman of International Business Machines Corp. , said Saturday .	6 0 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 0 1 2 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 27 185 10
There 's nothing rational about this kind of action .	50 51 23 24 84 6 1 12 1 10
Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week .	59 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 4 74 40 30 6 1 64 18 79 81 1 10
Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance .	36 0 0 1 4 19 0 1 2 19 0 1 13 19 6 0 1 12 124 6 1 16 34 38 0 1 10
The financial-services industry was battered by the 1987 crash .	6 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 10
What 's more , although the stock market is far less overvalued today than two years ago , the U.S. economy is weaker .	288 11 1 2 39 6 0 1 28 116 29 24 35 140 0 1 3 2 6 0 1 28 24 10
Growth is slower .	1 28 24 10
Profits are softer .	1 28 24 10
Debt burdens are heavier .	0 1 28 24 10
But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate .	76 39 6 0 1 4 35 154 18 79 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 4 35 79 10
The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets .	6 1 2 33 85 1 20 121 32 1 18 19 1 2 14 35 17 18 19 1 38 6 1 223 17 18 19 6 1 10
Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies .	0 1 4 77 66 23 4 35 35 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .	76 6 1 12 6 0 1 44 6 1 28 43 18 19 35 0 0 1 38 6 1 18 19 1 10
Anticipating the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625 % late Friday , down from 8.820 % the day before .	32 6 1 42 1 2 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 22 7 6 0 0 1 38 0 1 67 35 2 70 7 0 1 92 1 250 10
Tiny movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets .	0 1 12 6 1 2 33 11 119 1 108 23 24 38 0 1 2 48 35 7 6 0 0 1 138 6 1 11 38 6 0 1 10
The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the U.S. .	6 1 16 64 18 79 35 30 6 0 1 42 1 82 6 1 18 19 6 1 18 87 7 6 1 10
Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years .	0 1 20 121 207 38 1 66 6 1 42 1 28 53 7 1 12 0 1 2 113 18 19 6 0 1 33 20 21 1 38 0 1 10
The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar .	6 0 1 20 35 35 300 0 1 66 6 1 28 24 38 6 0 1 10
A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the U.S. .	6 0 1 12 6 1 238 52 6 0 1 2 19 23 106 4 74 40 38 6 1 10
That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. .	23 11 35 6 1 38 1 2 75 6 1 28 289 24 66 6 1 13 0 1 16 65 66 23 4 79 2 32 1 12 0 1 13 32 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 10
Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so comforting .	6 0 1 12 1 13 1 28 35 29 24 10
In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % .	59 6 0 1 12 1 2 6 1 34 38 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989 , which ended two weeks ago .	6 1 12 1 65 66 23 34 81 36 36 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 12 1 2 33 34 0 1 26 10
The plunge in stock prices is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , says economist Lawrence Chimerine of WEFA Group , a Bala Cynwyd , Pa. , forecasting company .	6 1 12 0 1 37 120 38 6 1 75 6 1 20 35 60 35 2 56 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 36 36 2 0 2 0 1 10
A lot of pent-up demand is gone .	6 1 12 0 1 14 40 10
Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- but only slightly and for a short period of time , recalls Mr. Zarnowitz , a longtime student of business cycles .	0 1 4 79 38 6 1 12 0 1 123 1282 13 102 13 13 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
That was offset by strength elsewhere .	23 14 40 38 1 78 10
-LCB- The effects -RCB- were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected .	166 6 1 167 28 116 29 24 13 29 24 47 23 20 60 13 60 10
Today , he frets , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers retrench in reaction .	76 2 23 44 2 1 13 0 0 1 4 115 43 18 19 35 6 1 30 0 1 34 81 1 13 30 1 34 38 1 10
What 's more , the corporate borrowing binge has n't abated in the past two years .	288 11 1 2 6 0 0 1 20 35 60 38 6 0 0 1 10
We 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt ... just at the time when earnings are being squeezed , Mr. Chimerine notes .	23 20 21 0 0 1 12 0 1 12 1 106 67 38 6 1 75 1 37 182 40 2 0 1 27 10
The more a company relies on borrowed money , the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown .	1283 24 6 1 48 7 0 1 2 1145 24 440 1 510 6 0 1 10
A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm ; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court .	6 1 12 6 0 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 91 6 36 0 1 4 79 35 38 0 1 10
The Fed , of course , knows that very well -- hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning .	6 1 2 85 1 2 11 23 67 35 106 185 440 1 18 19 1 38 6 1 81 1 10
But , in the process , the Fed risks reigniting inflation .	76 2 59 6 1 2 6 1 37 32 1 10
Even before Friday 's events , Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations .	137 59 1 42 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 37 207 66 6 1 4 35 115 43 18 87 35 7 6 0 1 93 32 1 70 7 6 1 18 19 0 0 1 2 1 13 36 0 1 10
The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons ; it 's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 69 78 11 35 1 2 23 27 91 23 11 6 1 12 0 1 10
In the end , the 1987 collapse suggested , the economy does n't move in lockstep with stock prices .	59 6 1 2 6 0 1 44 2 6 1 4 35 79 38 1 12 0 1 10
The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors .	6 1 4 2 35 2 87 7 6 1 12 1 2 1 13 0 1 10
A panic on Wall Street does n't exactly inspire confidence .	6 1 12 0 1 4 35 35 19 1 10
Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday .	1 65 66 0 1 28 24 38 1 10
A 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will .	6 0 1 1284 35 43 18 19 1 12 6 1 91 11 23 6 0 1 26 2 35 2 13 23 476 10
If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs , Va. , for the Business Council meetings are typical , business leaders were n't overly rattled by Friday 's decline .	39 6 1 12 1 40 35 38 0 1 2 1 2 38 6 0 0 1 28 24 2 0 1 14 35 16 40 38 1 42 1 10
And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it .	76 39 0 1 28 6 1 824 24 109 24 2 6 1 42 0 1 65 66 6 1 4 19 23 10
On the bottom line , the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before .	59 6 0 1 2 6 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 65 66 23 20 169 7 23 35 10
Two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression .	0 1 234 2 52 6 0 1 12 1 11 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 10
The doomsayers had a receptive audience .	6 1 11 6 0 1 10
The prosperity that followed Black Monday permits a more optimistic view today .	6 1 33 11 0 1 11 6 36 0 1 35 10
At the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last go-around .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 78 37 111 1 7 6 1 42 1 93 32 6 0 1 10

The chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business .	6 0 1 14 17 18 77 66 1 34 38 6 0 1 70 7 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
Producers of commodity chemicals , the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers , have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers .	1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 40 38 0 1 38 0 1 2 20 21 0 0 1 12 1 10
Once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now fading boom , these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the 1988 third quarter .	52 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 36 0 1 2 6 1 16 4 168 120 38 36 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
For some of these companies , this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons , says Leonard Bogner , a chemical industry analyst at Prudential Bache Research .	59 23 12 6 1 2 23 4 19 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10

Perhaps most prominent , Dow Chemical Co. , which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters , is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier , if only by a shade .	29 29 24 2 0 0 1 2 33 415 7 1 20 21 35 0 0 0 1 2 14 17 18 77 66 1 34 38 6 0 1 140 6 1 3 2 70 208 7 6 1 10
Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake in polyethylene , which is used in packaging and housewares .	39 1 20 16 60 38 0 1 13 1 2 6 1 16 11 6 0 1 12 1 2 33 14 40 38 1 13 1 10
Analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the Midland , Mich. , company are between $ 3.20 a share and $ 3.30 a share , compared with $ 3.36 a year ago , when profit was $ 632 million on sales of $ 4.15 billion .	1 42 0 1 12 6 36 2 0 2 1 48 7 86 9 92 1 13 86 9 92 1 2 70 7 86 9 6 1 107 2 391 1 11 86 0 9 38 1 12 86 0 9 10

Most of the 10 have big commodity-chemical operations .	1 12 6 1 11 0 0 1 10
Still , some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals .	76 2 6 0 1 14 17 18 19 0 1 2 67 30 0 1 12 6 1 48 7 0 1 10

According to the program 's publicity prospectus , Capital City , set at Shane Longman , a fictional mid-sized securities firm with # 500 million capital , follows the fortunes of a close-knit team of young , high-flying dealers , hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy .	122 7 6 1 42 0 1 2 0 1 2 40 38 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 12 125 0 9 1 2 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 2 0 1 2 22 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 1 13 1 10

The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives .	6 0 210 1 20 151 22 38 1 42 0 1 46 53 7 1 2 13 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 13 0 1 10

If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six-figure salaries , you still are left puzzled , because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously .	39 23 4 19 6 80 66 6 1 12 52 1 11 0 1 2 23 16 14 152 24 2 30 1 12 6 1 34 67 35 10

Perhaps without realizing it , Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution : Capital City should have been a comedy , a worthy sequel to the screwball British Carry On movies of the 1960s .	137 181 32 23 2 0 1 16 20 139 6 1 7 6 1 13 6 0 1 75 0 1 4 163 21 6 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 10

Axa-Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates .	0 1 12 1 11 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 125 0 9 1 12 0 0 1 2 38 0 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 75 1 34 10
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers .	6 0 1 11 1 12 0 0 1 42 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 2 0 2 0 13 0 0 1 33 11 1 12 36 0 1 10
In an attempt to appease U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T .	59 6 1 18 19 0 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 85 1 64 18 5 1 7 1 30 23 28 53 155 32 1 10
As part of the agreement , Axa agreed to invest $ 1 billion in Hoylake Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle .	59 1 12 6 1 2 1 64 18 19 86 0 9 38 0 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 10
Of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to Hoylake by Axa , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of Axa 's parent , Axa-Midi Group , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by Axa , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long-term bank loans .	59 6 0 86 0 9 18 74 22 7 1 38 1 2 0 86 0 9 4 79 38 0 1 12 1 42 1 2 0 1 2 86 0 9 4 87 7 6 1 12 1 40 38 1 2 13 6 0 86 0 9 4 87 7 0 0 1 10
In an interview Thursday , Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing .	59 6 1 76 2 0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 12 1 2 44 6 1 20 35 21 1 12 6 1 12 1 40 38 0 10 0 0 1 75 23 4 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said .	6 0 0 1 12 6 1 11 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 13 1 2 23 27 10
Mr. Bebear said Axa-Midi Group has more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell to help pay off debt from the acquisition .	0 1 44 0 1 11 24 227 86 0 9 12 0 1 138 23 4 13 4 19 18 143 19 35 1 12 6 1 10
He said the assets to be sold would be non-insurance assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers .	23 44 6 1 18 74 40 4 19 0 1 2 12 6 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 2 13 4 35 19 6 1 12 1 10
We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , he said .	23 4 35 5 6 1 7 1 2 23 27 10
The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T .	6 0 1 16 65 35 66 59 6 0 1 2 1 11 6 0 1 18 5 1 7 1 38 6 1 12 1 10
We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , Mr. Bebear said .	23 65 66 59 119 23 11 2 6 1 4 35 154 18 19 1 2 13 23 4 35 87 7 6 1 38 23 2 30 1 4 35 19 6 1 12 1 38 1 2 0 1 27 10
Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated .	6 1 12 1 12 1 11 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 75 1 13 6 0 1 14 40 10
The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .	6 0 1 14 40 70 7 6 0 1 12 1 13 1 2 13 18 19 6 1 138 0 1 11 67 35 38 0 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion -LRB- $ 20.71 billion -RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval .	1 11 6 0 125 0 9 526 527 0 9 171 0 1 30 23 11 6 1 2 13 44 23 4 19 6 0 1 30 13 208 6 0 1 12 1 12 1 11 0 1 10
A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , It would appear that nothing substantive has changed .	6 1 12 1 65 38 6 0 1 66 2 23 4 77 66 23 24 20 60 10
The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one , and Axa still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt .	6 0 0 1 11 35 6 0 1 123 2 13 1 16 64 18 5 35 0 1 12 1 42 1 7 1 18 19 6 1 10
That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added .	6 1 11 62 52 6 0 1 16 40 70 7 1 38 1 2 6 1 27 10
It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders .	23 4 19 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 10
To fend off Sir James 's advances , B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern .	18 19 35 0 1 42 1 2 1 20 21 6 0 1 33 4 5 23 7 6 0 13 0 0 1 10
Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year .	0 1 12 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 13 0 1 35 38 0 1 38 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American-made cars in the first 10 days of October , a 12.6 % drop from a year earlier .	6 0 0 0 0 1 11 0 36 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 12 1 2 6 36 0 1 158 6 1 3 10
Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4 % to 86,555 pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles .	36 0 0 1 28 179 0 1 7 0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 10
The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which began officially Oct. 1 .	6 0 1 12 1 18 19 35 0 1 64 18 163 139 6 1 2 248 148 35 2 161 7 0 0 1 2 33 34 35 8 9 10
This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level .	23 28 29 24 38 1 2 33 11 0 1 38 1 13 1 13 282 6 0 0 0 13 0 1 79 67 35 38 0 1 42 36 0 1 10
Overall , sales of all domestic-made vehicles fell 11.9 % from a year ago .	76 2 1 12 6 0 1 34 67 35 140 6 1 3 10
Without GM , overall sales for the other U.S. automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results .	59 1 2 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 28 29 53 7 0 1 10
Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up .	23 12 6 0 0 1 20 35 21 1 12 0 0 1 2 13 23 4 154 18 19 6 1 18 178 1 24 10
We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , said Tom Kelly , sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn , Mich .	23 20 21 6 1 75 2 59 1 2 23 11 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 10
Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since October 1987 .	0 1 34 38 6 36 0 0 0 1 12 36 0 1 2 6 1 12 1 123 10
The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month .	6 0 1 48 7 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 123 69 78 10
Furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline .	76 2 1 40 67 67 35 44 23 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 10
GM 's domestic car sales dropped 24.3 % and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7 % from the same period a year ago .	1 42 0 0 1 34 67 35 13 6 0 1 28 179 6 36 0 0 1 7 6 0 1 6 1 107 10
All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines .	23 12 6 0 1 12 1 11 0 1 10
Cadillac posted a 3.2 % increase despite new competition from Lexus , the fledging luxury-car division of Toyota Motor Corp .	1 11 6 36 0 1 38 0 1 12 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month-end .	0 1 28 35 24 91 6 1 14 40 13 1 11 6 1 67 38 1 10
The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer rebates and low-interest financing , a company spokesman said .	6 0 1 12 6 0 210 0 1 4 163 151 40 38 1 38 6 1 12 1 12 0 1 138 1 11 38 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 2 6 0 1 27 10
Last year , GM had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold .	137 76 2 1 11 6 0 1 38 1 90 37 32 1 30 52 6 0 1 20 151 40 10
Aside from GM , other car makers posted generally mixed results .	122 7 1 2 0 0 1 11 36 0 1 10
Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales .	0 0 1 11 6 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 6 36 0 1 12 0 0 1 10

However , sales of trucks , including the company 's popular minivans , rose 4.3 % .	76 2 1 12 1 2 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 34 67 35 10

We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , he added .	23 28 29 285 23 4 79 70 46 24 2 23 27 10
Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models .	76 2 1 44 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 1 4 79 81 1 68 0 1 12 36 0 0 1 10
Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall .	0 1 48 35 7 1 12 6 0 1 40 67 81 1 10
At that time , Chrysler said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % on most vehicle .	59 6 1 2 1 44 0 1 2 33 14 35 22 7 0 1 2 4 19 0 0 1 13 0 1 38 0 1 10

It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U.S. Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies .	192 383 35 29 24 171 66 6 0 1 40 38 6 0 1 106 13 67 38 6 0 0 1 106 14 22 38 1 78 155 32 1 2 1 13 1 10

I think this is a victory for the radio , says Barnabas de Bueky , a 55-year-old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich , West Germany , headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service .	23 44 23 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 33 48 38 6 36 2 36 0 2 1 7 0 1 12 6 0 1 10

But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one .	76 6 0 1 40 35 38 1 13 0 1 37 32 6 1 42 1 38 0 1 12 1 10
In fact , Radio Free Europe is in danger of suffering from its success .	59 1 2 0 0 1 48 7 1 93 45 7 6 1 10
While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest , so can others .	39 6 1 16 4 79 35 38 1 2 76 242 1 10
In addition , competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled .	59 1 2 1 12 1 37 156 53 7 0 1 1238 55 120 35 14 16 40 10
Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism , Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring .	122 155 182 22 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 0 0 1 28 29 43 18 19 6 80 66 6 1 28 29 24 2 29 24 10

Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable .	1 567 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 18 178 23 24 13 154 18 115 29 53 7 1 2 6 1 42 1 37 113 18 115 29 24 10

Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location .	137 523 529 6 0 1 12 0 1 19 0 0 1 42 0 1 2 76 6 1 12 1 11 23 116 29 24 106 23 108 23 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 689 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 33 4 19 6 0 1 10
That is a miracle .	23 11 6 1 10
It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents -LRB- who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters -RRB- .	23 11 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 33 64 18 19 1 12 6 1 13 1 12 0 1 166 33 11 1 12 6 1 38 1 2 0 1 13 1 167 10
In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian listeners say they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the Dark Ages of the 20th Century .	59 1 2 23 12 6 1 42 0 1 44 23 108 0 0 1 1 30 23 28 365 7 0 1 155 327 1 24 38 119 0 1 78 108 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10

The listeners , too , had to be brave .	6 1 2 16 2 64 18 115 24 10

Every moment we want to know everything about the world .	103 1 23 64 18 19 23 12 6 1 10
Proposals for government-operated national service , like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew .	1 12 0 0 1 2 85 1 2 34 35 97 1 38 1 2 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 11 6 1 2 13 64 18 79 2 16 18 19 13 19 0 1 35 10
The disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service .	6 0 1 48 38 1 2 38 1 2 35 7 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 10
Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with smallpox .	76 2 23 14 22 7 1 93 113 18 19 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 138 1 232 20 151 40 38 6 0 1 2 70 7 1 10
It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a National and Community Service Act , a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall .	23 239 24 7 23 35 2 38 6 1 12 1 18 19 1 38 6 1 13 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 92 1 10
Why does the national-service virus keep coming back ?	243 244 6 0 1 168 120 35 10
Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel .	76 23 397 346 0 1 11 52 0 1 13 6 0 1 10
If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving .	39 105 23 4 5 1 42 0 1 7 296 148 6 0 1 23 4 115 43 18 19 1 35 13 19 6 1 12 1 10
A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft .	6 1 12 6 1 234 0 1 14 22 7 6 1 93 32 6 0 1 12 6 1 70 155 2 212 6 1 2 32 6 1 10
Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many national-service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion .	23 12 23 33 11 6 1 35 65 35 66 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 11 35 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 38 6 80 66 0 1 11 6 1 10
Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft .	1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 64 18 221 0 1 0 1 12 6 1 10
But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose .	76 6 1 14 152 24 38 0 1 140 6 1 12 1 3 2 47 23 16 14 152 24 10
This time it attempted to invade two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans .	103 1 23 64 18 19 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 1 10
Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ?	712 185 19 13 16 19 6 1 13 1 2 6 1 34 2 13 5 6 1 12 1 7 6 1 10
Military service , moreover , could be a national-service option .	0 1 2 16 2 4 19 6 0 1 10
Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay-as-you-go moderates , and idealistic liberals .	76 2 76 192 358 351 66 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 115 24 2 32 0 1 2 0 1 2 13 0 1 10
The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents .	6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 32 6 1 2 16 44 23 4 134 6 1 18 19 1 2 67 38 0 1 13 6 1 10
A provision allowing grants to be applied to first-home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .	6 1 229 1 18 74 22 7 0 1 14 40 18 87 7 23 33 20 21 1 12 1 10
The DLC plan envisaged volunteers planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care .	6 0 1 235 1 111 1 2 111 1 2 111 1 2 13 111 1 7 86 9 92 1 2 1 3 2 13 0 1 10
With a tax-free $ 10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 a year .	59 6 0 125 9 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 4 168 32 6 1 24 84 86 9 92 1 10
Mind you , most of the volunteers would be unskilled 17 - to 18-year-olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home .	59 23 2 1 12 6 1 4 19 0 0 106 0 1 2 23 29 29 24 171 171 2 13 1 126 1 399 120 38 1 10
They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families .	23 4 168 156 53 171 7 0 1 84 0 1 120 38 6 0 1 12 1 13 16 32 1 10
As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of give in order to get .	39 23 34 2 0 1 34 38 0 13 0 1 33 48 7 6 0 0 0 1 2 30 6 0 1 64 18 19 6 36 0 1 238 407 1091 1 18 79 10
Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped .	1 12 0 1 12 6 1 2 33 64 18 19 6 0 0 1 2 16 48 49 6 0 1 182 40 10
Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up .	76 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 64 18 74 40 35 10
What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ?	52 0 1 18 79 38 0 0 1 42 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 75 52 6 0 1 12 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 30 23 4 74 40 35 13 22 7 0 1 10
In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn -RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la Sen. Chris Dodd -RRB- , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -LRB- a Kennedy specialty -RRB- , a community service work-study program for students -LRB- pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers , among others -RRB- , plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer , Foster Grandparent , and Senior Companion programs .	59 6 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 48 7 32 0 0 0 1 38 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 158 29 53 7 6 1 13 0 0 1 167 2 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 158 29 29 29 29 24 167 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 18 19 0 13 0 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 167 2 6 0 0 0 1 12 1 158 53 7 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 12 1 167 2 13 1 12 6 0 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 13 0 0 1 10
Before the menu is printed , the House may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million .	39 6 1 14 40 2 6 1 4 19 0 1 2 16 32 6 0 1 2 16 22 7 6 86 0 9 10
It is widely known that too many cooks spoil the broth , but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if they are senators .	23 14 35 351 66 52 6 1 11 6 1 2 13 6 1 4 35 35 19 6 1 12 6 1 2 67 30 23 11 1 10
The omnibus bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard .	6 0 1 120 70 7 1 4 19 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 28 24 13 6 1 37 32 6 1 67 35 10
The aroma of patronage is in the air .	6 1 12 1 48 7 6 1 10
Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ?	343 6 0 1 289 24 66 23 11 52 0 1 10
On the contrary , it is as robust as ever .	59 6 1 2 23 28 29 53 46 24 10
According to the Gallup Poll , American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- .	122 7 6 0 1 2 0 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 92 1 12 1 2 30 0 1 12 1 85 6 1 20 60 67 35 552 22 7 1 167 10
Even if government does see various unmet needs , national service is not the way to meet them .	137 39 1 4 19 0 0 1 2 0 1 11 35 6 1 18 19 23 10
If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called scholarship , rather than on the government 's idea of service .	39 23 64 18 19 1 2 23 4 19 6 1 40 38 0 1 93 32 0 1 40 38 23 15 1 2 102 13 38 6 1 42 1 12 1 10
Or we might provide a tax credit for working students .	76 23 4 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 10
What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a GI Bill .	119 23 4 35 154 18 19 4 19 6 1 2 13 16 154 18 19 23 57 32 6 0 1 10
To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor-saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short-term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs .	59 6 1 23 11 1 18 19 0 1 12 1 2 59 1 2 23 4 19 1 2 19 0 1 2 13 19 0 0 1 2 102 13 19 0 0 1 38 0 1 13 19 1 12 0 1 628 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?	244 0 1 2 12 6 0 36 0 13 0 1 19 0 1 18 74 40 10
Not necessarily .	29 24 10
Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing .	1 73 0 2 0 1 7 6 0 1 12 1 2 13 6 1 69 12 1 11 6 0 0 1 10
Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting associations , societies and councils , some of which may hope to receive the paid volunteers .	76 2 0 1 37 32 6 1 12 52 1 2 1 13 1 2 23 12 361 4 154 18 19 6 0 1 10
So far , the president seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free-standing proposal to endow a Points of Light foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism .	137 76 2 6 1 28 43 18 5 23 12 6 1 7 6 0 0 1 18 5 6 0 71 1 1 7 86 0 9 18 19 1 12 6 1 13 5 23 7 0 1 10
However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in brokering federal funds for volunteer projects .	76 2 52 6 0 1 4 115 24 30 6 0 1 48 35 7 0 0 1 18 87 7 6 1 12 6 1 42 1 13 18 19 6 0 1 57 111 0 1 7 0 1 10
There 's no need for such concessions .	50 51 6 1 12 52 1 10
National service , the utopian idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but the millions of knee-socked youth performing works of civic content will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors .	0 1 2 6 0 1 2 16 4 35 79 35 35 2 38 1 2 13 6 1 12 0 1 32 1 12 0 1 4 74 40 67 38 6 1 12 6 1 10

The debate over National Service has begun again .	6 1 12 0 1 20 60 35 10
After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high-school graduation , the focus has shifted to Washington .	59 6 1 12 124 24 25 0 1 11 6 0 1 13 0 1 13 1 12 0 1 108 0 1 6 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 20 60 38 1 10

One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , Ga . -RRB- and Rep. Dave McCurdy -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served .	1 2 40 38 0 0 1 217 1 2 1 10 167 13 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 167 2 4 163 139 0 0 1 7 1 33 20 60 10

Doctrine and special interests govern some responses .	1 13 0 1 11 6 1 10
So do those who seek a re-energized concept of citizenship , a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights .	205 206 23 33 11 6 0 1 12 1 2 6 1 32 0 1 102 102 13 32 1 10
Then there are instinctive opponents .	76 50 51 0 1 10
To libertarians , mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money .	59 1 2 0 1 11 6 1 13 0 1 11 0 1 12 0 1 10
Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform :	1 12 6 1 11 6 1 12 6 1 0 1 4 19 106
If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost .	39 6 1 4 35 87 7 23 2 23 34 2 23 4 35 115 126 6 1 10
Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the regimentation of youth , or want to see rights enlarged , not obligations .	1 12 6 1 14 35 16 40 91 23 73 1 7 6 1 12 6 1 2 13 11 6 1 12 1 2 13 64 18 555 1 40 2 185 270 10
But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ?	76 569 7 23 12 23 135 1 14 35 40 38 1 13 1 10
How should we think about national service ?	243 244 23 87 7 0 1 10
Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- national service has no agreed meaning .	344 23 79 57 32 6 0 1 12 1 30 0 1 11 0 0 1 10
Would service be voluntary or compulsory ?	244 1 115 24 13 24 10
Short or long ?	24 13 24 10
Part-time or full-time ?	24 13 24 10
Paid or unpaid ?	24 13 24 10
Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ?	244 1 79 38 1 13 79 35 13 79 38 1 13 79 38 0 1 10
What kinds of work would they do ?	454 1 217 1 244 23 19 10
What does national mean ?	420 244 1 19 10
Would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ?	244 6 1 74 40 38 6 0 1 2 38 0 1 2 13 38 0 0 1 10
And who would serve ?	588 268 4 79 10
Only males , as with the draft , or both sexes ?	0 1 2 69 12 6 1 2 13 6 1 10
Youth only or all ages ?	1 123 13 6 1 10
Middle-class people , or poor people , or a genuine cross-section ?	0 1 2 13 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 10
Many or few ?	24 13 24 10
Those are not trivial questions , and the label national service answers none of them .	23 11 35 0 1 2 13 6 1 69 78 11 1 12 23 10
Then how should we think about national service ?	76 243 244 23 79 38 0 1 10
As a starting point , here are five propositions : 1 . Consider the ingredients , not the name .	59 6 0 1 2 1 11 0 1 808 16 10 19 6 1 2 52 6 1 10
Ignore national service in the abstract ; consider specific proposals .	19 0 1 12 6 1 91 19 0 1 10
They will differ in crucial ways .	23 4 79 38 0 1 10
2 . Service should be service .	76 10 1 4 19 1 10
As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice .	218 16 40 2 1 11 1 10
It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career .	23 37 32 1 2 13 32 35 1 2 13 32 6 1 10
It follows that proposals like Nunn-McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify .	23 65 66 1 12 1 2 135 1 217 1 28 126 6 86 9 92 1 2 4 35 79 10
There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to a GI Bill without the GI ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given .	50 51 6 1 12 52 1 104 0 1 12 0 1 48 7 6 0 1 12 6 1 91 76 6 1 4 74 40 2 16 40 10
But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs .	76 6 1 11 38 0 1 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 0 1 10
Why call that service ?	712 221 23 1 10
3 . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not .	76 10 1 28 24 91 1 34 35 10
Compelled service is unconstitutional .	0 1 28 24 10
It is also unwise and unenforceable .	23 28 35 24 13 24 10
-LRB- Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year ? -RRB-	166 246 4 19 36 36 0 1 38 1 81 1 10 167
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior .	76 59 0 1 13 59 0 1 6 0 1 11 0 1 12 1 10
It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages .	23 4 35 19 1 106 69 12 6 1 13 6 1 10
Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing .	6 1 4 19 13 16 19 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 1 2 4 79 38 6 0 1 69 12 1 2 13 4 19 0 1 54 442 1 16 11 1 10
4 . Good programs are not cheap .	76 10 0 1 28 35 24 10
Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought , housing rehabilitated , students tutored , day-care centers staffed .	1 65 66 0 1 4 215 0 1 34 35 1287 0 1 40 2 1 40 2 1 40 2 0 1 40 10
There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply .	50 51 0 1 18 74 40 2 13 0 1 13 0 1 20 174 66 0 1 33 48 7 0 1 4 19 1 12 23 35 106 13 35 35 10
Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality .	0 0 1 11 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 409 23 684 0 1 10
They involve stipends to participants .	23 11 1 12 1 10
Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale .	0 0 1 16 19 1 13 0 1 91 23 115 29 24 106 171 631 1 631 6 1 12 1 13 1 10
Non-residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year .	0 1 28 24 2 13 0 1 16 48 7 6 86 9 92 1 10
Are they worth that ?	343 23 126 23 10
Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted .	1 65 66 0 1 34 140 24 171 30 6 1 12 1 14 40 10
But the calculations are challengeable .	76 6 1 28 24 10
5 . Underclass youth are a special concern .	76 10 0 1 11 6 0 1 10
Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ?	343 52 1 24 2 185 10
Yes , if targeted .	431 2 720 40 10
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost .	1 12 6 1 13 6 1 4 74 17 18 79 2 13 50 51 0 302 198 0 1 2 13 6 1 2 18 87 7 0 0 1 10
They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers .	23 4 79 38 23 12 1 12 0 1 2 13 79 38 0 1 40 38 0 1 13 40 38 1 13 1 10
Underclass youth do n't have those opportunities .	0 1 4 35 19 6 1 10
They are not enrolled in high school or college .	23 28 35 53 7 0 1 13 1 10
They are unlikely to be employed .	23 28 43 18 74 40 10
And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self-destructive behaviors and bleak prospects .	76 23 20 60 35 38 36 0 1 2 31 0 1 120 35 2 40 38 0 1 13 0 1 10
But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service .	76 1 12 23 4 74 67 35 40 38 0 13 0 1 10
Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons .	23 4 35 19 6 1 91 1 34 35 38 0 1 10
But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed .	76 23 138 23 78 37 32 14 40 10
Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them .	32 1 2 32 23 35 2 156 24 2 23 28 67 35 24 104 1 16 34 38 23 10
Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune-grass with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation .	137 39 192 193 24 18 19 1 13 19 1 13 19 1 38 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 1 32 6 1 11 6 1 10
Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service .	16 120 2 6 1 37 35 32 1 10
They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk .	23 37 32 35 6 1 2 32 6 1 2 32 6 1 10
But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future .	76 23 82 23 18 168 120 2 13 23 64 18 19 23 166 13 1 167 2 18 19 1 12 6 1 2 18 87 7 6 1 10
That is a service to the nation .	23 11 6 1 12 6 1 10
It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve .	23 11 119 0 1 4 154 35 18 19 10

Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet .	0 1 78 13 12 0 1 11 1 12 6 1 18 19 35 6 0 0 1 106 13 48 161 7 6 1 18 178 6 1 24 10
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis .	0 0 0 0 1 48 7 6 1 2 758 192 53 7 1 217 6 1 13 123 66 6 1 28 43 18 19 0 1 12 1 38 6 0 1 2 30 23 34 38 1 123 2 30 6 1 14 40 18 19 6 0 1 10
And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge .	76 59 6 1 2 0 0 1 48 7 1 13 1 12 0 1 30 0 0 0 1 16 11 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters .	76 6 1 65 66 6 0 1 4 35 19 0 1 10
In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout .	59 1 2 1 12 6 1 13 12 6 0 1 65 66 32 0 1 13 1 38 6 1 4 221 23 0 1 13 1 437 1 42 0 1 87 7 6 1 42 1 10
The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , said one government official , insisting on anonymity .	6 1 85 6 1 65 66 23 23 11 33 48 273 23 37 32 0 1 64 18 19 6 1 12 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 45 7 1 10
The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning .	6 1 42 1 12 1 14 35 40 67 35 2 117 52 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 11 1 252 6 0 0 1 214 6 0 1 28 43 18 19 1 38 6 0 1 67 35 10
Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment .	0 0 1 14 40 38 6 1 2 70 7 0 1 2 13 44 23 20 35 21 6 0 1 10
Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan .	76 2 0 1 44 6 1 11 36 0 1 12 6 0 1 42 0 1 10
It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat .	23 28 43 18 19 6 0 1 23 11 38 1 123 2 111 1 7 6 1 140 24 18 178 6 0 1 24 10
The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions .	6 1 73 1 7 6 0 1 57 111 0 1 7 0 1 10
The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC 's This Week .	6 1 12 0 1 28 24 38 6 1 78 112 52 52 0 1 12 1 948 6 1 10
Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact .	0 71 6 1 1 13 0 1 13 6 1 12 6 1 13 1 20 169 7 0 1 10
I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's sensible , he said .	23 28 285 23 4 19 118 28 24 2 118 28 24 2 118 28 24 2 23 27 10

But , in this context , that 's the smart thing to do .	76 2 59 6 1 2 23 11 6 0 1 18 19 10
At the Treasury , Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market 's drop .	59 6 1 2 0 1 11 6 1 32 6 0 1 42 1 10
Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , he said .	1 42 0 0 1 4 35 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 23 27 10
The economy remains well-balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth .	6 1 28 24 2 13 6 1 48 7 0 0 1 10
But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week .	76 0 1 65 66 1 42 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 92 1 10
One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named .	0 1 65 66 23 11 6 0 1 2 29 24 84 6 1 2 13 52 6 0 1 2 56 0 0 0 1 2 33 16 65 262 23 16 74 40 10
The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago .	6 1 65 66 23 11 6 0 1 2 158 0 1 3 10

Resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks .	19 6 1 18 19 6 1 13 19 52 6 1 10
That 's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday 's 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .	23 11 6 1 12 0 0 1 38 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10

But they 're nearly unanimous on one point : Do n't sell into a panic .	76 23 28 29 24 38 0 1 808 143 35 79 38 6 1 10
Investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to regret it .	1 33 11 23 38 6 1 12 1 64 18 19 23 10
Even after Friday 's plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 48 % above where it landed on Oct. 19 two years ago .	137 59 1 42 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 48 0 1 1288 55 23 34 38 86 9 0 1 26 10
Panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past .	0 1 16 28 24 38 0 0 1 12 6 1 10
The crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began .	6 1 12 1 14 22 7 6 0 1 38 6 0 1 13 0 0 1 217 6 1 1289 10
The October massacres of 1978 and 1979 were scary , but did n't lead to severe or sustained downturns .	6 0 1 12 1 13 1 28 24 2 13 4 35 87 7 0 13 0 1 10
Indeed , some pros see Friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain hunting .	76 2 6 1 73 1 42 1 2 13 6 0 1 33 4 79 67 81 1 2 7 6 1 12 0 1 10
There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , says Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc .	50 150 21 6 1 12 0 1 33 11 6 0 0 1 30 23 20 21 6 1 2 56 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 10
But most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat .	76 0 1 44 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 154 18 115 24 10
When you see a runaway train , says Steve Janachowski , partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm Brouwer & Janachowski , you wait for the train to stop .	39 23 11 6 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 23 592 198 6 1 18 79 10
Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do -- the advice is : Wait for the market to bounce back , and sell shares gradually during rallies .	137 59 1 33 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 30 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 34 106 6 1 4 106 379 198 6 1 18 79 35 2 13 19 1 35 38 1 10
The best thing individual investors can do is just sit tight , says Marshall B. Front , executive vice president and head of investment counseling at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc. , a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ 18 billion .	6 0 1 0 1 4 19 368 16 34 35 2 56 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 13 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 33 11 0 86 0 9 10
On the one hand , Mr. Front says , it would be misguided to sell into a classic panic .	59 6 0 1 2 0 1 44 2 192 283 284 24 18 79 38 6 0 1 10
On the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy .	59 6 0 1 2 23 11 67 35 6 0 1 18 79 35 13 79 10
This is all emotion right now , and when emotion starts to run , it can run further than anyone anticipates , he said .	23 11 6 1 67 35 2 13 39 1 64 18 79 2 23 4 79 35 117 23 34 2 23 27 10
So it 's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize .	76 192 193 29 24 18 79 13 194 55 1 34 10
Roger Ibbotson , professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm Ibbotson Associates Inc. , says , My real advice would be to just ride through it .	0 1 2 1 12 1 12 0 1 13 1 12 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 44 2 6 0 1 4 154 18 35 79 38 23 10

Mr. Ibbotson thinks that this week is going to be a roller-coaster week .	0 1 65 66 6 1 37 113 18 19 6 0 1 10

John Snyder , former president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association of Investors Corp. , an organization of investment clubs and individual investors , says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no reason to sell now .	0 1 2 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 1 13 0 1 2 44 6 0 0 1 4 35 79 38 6 1 12 1 2 13 11 6 1 18 79 35 10

We understand panics and euphoria .	23 11 1 13 1 10

One camp of investment pros sees what happened Friday as an opportunity .	0 1 12 0 1 73 118 34 35 7 6 1 10

Stocks such as Hershey Foods Corp. , Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , American International Group Inc. and Federal National Mortgage Association became such bargains that he could n't resist them , he says .	1 69 12 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 0 1 11 52 1 75 23 4 35 19 23 2 23 27 10
And Mr. Craig expects to pick up more shares today .	76 0 1 64 18 19 35 0 1 35 10
It will be chaotic at first , but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble , he says .	23 4 115 24 140 24 2 13 23 4 35 168 120 30 23 44 23 14 40 38 0 1 2 23 27 10
He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987 .	23 65 66 1 14 16 40 35 2 13 66 0 1 28 24 35 70 7 6 1 12 1 10
Mr. Front of Stein Roe suggests that any buying should concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction .	0 1 12 0 1 65 66 6 1 4 79 38 1 33 20 21 6 1 38 6 0 1 2 13 1 33 20 151 152 24 81 1 208 68 6 1 38 6 1 10
His firm favors selected computer , drug and pollution-control stocks .	6 1 11 0 0 2 0 13 0 1 10
Other investment pros are more pessimistic .	0 0 1 28 29 24 10
They say investors should sell stocks -- but not necessarily right away .	23 44 1 4 19 1 106 13 96 67 67 35 10
Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly , gradual , and done when stock prices are rallying .	1 12 23 65 66 6 1 4 115 24 2 24 2 24 34 30 0 1 37 120 10
On Thursday , William Fleckenstein , a Seattle money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline .	59 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 82 0 1 12 6 0 1 18 19 6 80 66 6 0 0 1 4 79 10
He thinks the underlying inflation rate is around 5 % to 6 % , far higher than most people suppose .	23 44 6 0 0 1 11 0 0 1 132 0 1 2 29 24 47 0 1 34 10
In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. Fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge .	59 6 0 1 23 11 2 0 1 20 21 0 1 13 60 38 0 13 0 0 1 2 67 38 6 0 1 10
He thinks government officials are terrified to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high .	23 44 0 1 28 43 18 344 6 1 79 30 0 2 210 13 210 0 1 28 29 24 10
So he thinks the government will err on the side of rekindled inflation .	76 23 44 6 1 4 79 38 6 1 12 0 1 10
As a result , Mr. Fleckenstein says , I think the ball game 's over , and investors are about to face a bear market .	59 6 1 2 0 1 44 2 23 44 6 0 1 28 24 2 13 1 37 113 18 19 6 0 1 10
David M. Jones , vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. , recommends Treasury securities -LRB- of up to five years ' maturity -RRB- .	0 0 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 0 0 1 2 11 0 1 166 12 36 36 0 1 42 1 167 10
He says the Oct. 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors .	23 44 6 0 0 0 1 2 32 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 12 1 10
One strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy put options , either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index .	0 1 12 1 33 64 18 115 24 13 11 6 1 64 18 19 0 1 2 69 12 6 0 1 23 11 13 12 6 0 0 1 10
A put option gives its holder the right -LRB- but not the obligation -RRB- to sell a stock -LRB- or stock index -RRB- for a specified price -LRB- the strike price -RRB- until the option expires .	6 0 1 108 6 1 6 1 166 1 704 132 1 167 18 5 6 1 166 13 0 1 167 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 167 30 6 1 34 10
Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option .	55 6 1 28 24 354 7 6 1 12 6 1 10
The cost , or premium , tends to get fat in times of crisis .	6 1 2 13 1 2 64 18 115 24 38 1 12 1 10
Thus , buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk .	76 2 32 1 38 6 0 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 18 87 7 1 10
The prices of puts generally did n't soar Friday .	6 1 12 1 16 4 35 79 35 10
For example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on Eli Lilly & Co. moved up from 3 % at Thursday 's close to only 3.3 % at Friday 's close , even though the shares dropped more than $ 5.50 .	59 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 28 24 38 0 1 68 1 42 1 38 36 0 1 68 1 42 1 2 67 30 6 1 11 24 227 86 9 10
But put-option prices may zoom when trading resumes today .	76 0 1 4 79 30 1 34 35 10
It 's hard to generalize about a reasonable price for puts .	192 193 24 18 87 7 6 0 1 12 1 10
But investors should keep in mind , before paying too much , that the average annual return for stock holdings , long-term , is 9 % to 10 % a year ; a return of 15 % is considered praiseworthy .	76 1 4 77 38 1 2 57 120 67 35 2 66 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 16 2 11 0 1 132 0 1 92 1 91 6 1 12 0 1 14 152 24 10
Paying , say , 10 % for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return .	120 2 35 2 0 1 12 1 12 1 73 6 0 1 161 7 6 1 10

Coldwell Banker Commercial Group said it sold $ 47 million of common stock to its employees at $ 10 a share , giving them a total stake of more than 40 % in the commercial real estate brokerage firm .	0 0 0 1 44 23 385 86 0 9 12 0 1 7 6 1 7 86 9 92 1 2 146 23 6 0 1 12 24 25 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 0 1 10
The firm , which was acquired in April from Sears , Roebuck & Co. in a management-led buy-out , had planned to sell up to $ 56.4 million of stock , or a 50 % stake in the company , to its 5,000 employees .	6 1 2 33 14 22 38 1 7 1 2 78 78 78 38 6 0 1 2 20 94 18 5 0 0 86 0 9 12 1 2 13 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 2 7 6 0 1 10

He noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan , where a company usually borrows money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time , here employees had to fork out their own cash for the stock .	23 65 66 59 6 0 0 0 1 2 75 6 1 16 73 1 7 0 0 1 18 19 1 138 23 11 35 18 19 1 38 1 2 76 1 64 18 5 35 6 0 1 7 6 1 10

It 's totally different .	23 28 29 24 10

Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .	59 6 1 120 38 6 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 4 79 38 0 1 30 6 1 34 13 34 67 35 68 1 42 1 2 81 1 24 84 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc .	6 1 12 6 1 4 154 18 19 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 33 4 74 40 38 52 6 0 1 12 6 1 10
That early-morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the 1987 crash .	6 0 1 11 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 40 38 6 0 1 10
The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume .	6 0 1 16 11 0 1 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 10
Several of those post-crash changes kicked in during Friday 's one-hour collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge .	1 12 6 0 1 34 35 38 1 42 0 1 13 34 223 40 2 67 30 23 4 35 19 6 0 1 10
But the major circuit breakers have yet to be evaluated .	76 6 0 0 1 64 35 18 74 40 10
A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test .	6 0 0 1 16 4 221 23 6 0 1 10
A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash .	6 0 1 16 4 19 1 12 6 1 12 0 2 36 0 1 40 106 13 16 40 106 38 6 0 1 10
Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary .	137 76 2 1 12 6 0 1 40 38 6 0 0 1 2 33 11 6 0 1 2 4 74 40 409 76 346 6 1 42 1 11 35 6 0 1 10
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 37 229 6 0 0 1 18 19 0 0 1 2 69 93 32 0 0 1 12 6 0 13 0 1 10
But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended .	76 59 6 1 2 1 34 38 6 1 33 14 22 7 1 2 13 0 1 13 1 44 6 0 1 34 223 40 10
Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as hot-line communications among exchanges .	0 0 13 0 1 11 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 40 67 38 6 1 42 0 0 1 42 0 1 2 102 102 13 0 1 12 1 10
Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .	6 1 106 295 0 1 734 0 1 1 13 295 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 6 1 107 106 82 1 18 5 13 5 1 7 1 12 13 24 84 6 0 1 10
During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's Sidecar computer program automatically was triggered .	59 6 0 1 2 39 6 0 1 20 60 67 35 2 6 0 1 42 0 0 1 16 14 40 10
That system is designed to separate computer-generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks .	6 1 14 17 18 5 0 0 1 7 6 0 1 18 344 0 1 19 0 1 12 0 1 10
One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well-drilled school .	0 0 1 73 6 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 7 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , said Howard Dubnow , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor .	23 4 35 19 6 1 13 23 11 651 18 19 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 10
There was no panic .	50 51 6 1 10
The system worked the way we devised it to work .	6 1 11 6 1 23 82 23 18 79 10
After reopening for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its 30-point limit and the second freeze went into effect .	181 120 38 36 0 1 2 6 0 1 34 38 6 0 1 13 6 0 1 48 7 1 10
Traders then spent the last half-hour watching to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , Mr. Dubnow added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour .	1 16 235 6 0 1 113 18 194 55 6 1 4 79 67 35 2 0 1 27 2 45 7 6 1 12 124 6 0 1 78 4 163 60 38 6 1 10
One observer estimated that 80 % to 90 % of the S&P traders were just standing around watching .	0 1 65 66 0 1 132 0 1 12 6 0 1 37 35 133 35 120 10
But the 250-point circuit breaker never had to kick in , and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered .	76 6 0 0 1 16 64 18 79 35 2 13 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 16 14 35 40 10
The MMI and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies .	6 1 13 6 1 123 11 6 0 0 1 17 38 0 1 18 19 6 0 0 1 10
The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash .	6 1 14 17 38 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
The process of post-crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments .	6 1 12 0 1 34 38 1 18 19 6 1 13 48 35 6 1 26 7 6 1 12 36 0 1 10
In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated .	59 1 123 2 137 59 6 0 1 2 1 28 53 7 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 6 0 1 14 40 13 40 10
Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions .	59 6 0 1 6 0 1 14 152 24 38 6 1 12 1 18 19 0 0 1 57 32 1 18 221 0 1 1 18 19 13 19 1 10
In addition , limits were placed on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets .	59 1 2 1 14 40 38 0 1 2 13 1 14 40 18 16 19 6 0 13 0 1 10
Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated .	0 1 14 40 38 6 1 6 1 14 40 10
At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill .	59 6 1 6 0 1 11 0 1 2 33 14 16 40 13 16 40 38 0 1 10
There were also calls to strip the stock markets of derivative products , such as stock-index futures and options , which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin , for example , likened to barnacles attached to the basic market .	50 51 35 1 18 5 6 0 1 7 0 1 2 69 12 0 1 13 1 2 138 0 0 0 1 2 85 1 2 73 7 1 22 7 6 0 1 10
And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers .	76 50 51 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 42 1 93 278 0 1 79 38 1 2 13 0 1 10
When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda .	39 6 0 0 1 42 0 1 12 6 1 14 40 38 1 123 2 23 16 11 6 1 42 1 10
Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers .	207 66 6 0 0 1 48 7 1 2 13 207 66 6 1 20 21 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 48 155 229 6 1 18 19 6 1 2 18 178 1 53 7 1 2 18 19 0 1 13 18 19 0 1 10
Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented .	52 6 1 12 6 1 16 14 40 10
The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .	6 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 38 1 42 1 13 82 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 106 18 19 6 1 13 23 12 0 0 1 10
In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers .	59 1 123 2 6 0 1 2 22 35 7 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 1 2 6 0 13 0 1 2 13 6 0 0 0 1 2 16 11 0 0 1 10
After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .	59 0 0 1 12 1 12 0 0 1 13 0 1 2 0 1 14 40 38 1 2 31 6 0 1 32 1 38 36 13 36 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists .	76 2 6 0 1 73 52 1 7 1 12 1 10
After all , this free-market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century .	59 23 2 6 0 1 44 2 6 1 16 11 24 25 0 1 38 6 1 10

China 's year-long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets .	1 42 0 0 1 20 21 6 1 93 32 0 0 1 13 32 1 13 20 94 18 19 0 1 12 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 10

The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to become very unreasonable and reduce needed funds for investment in the already difficult state budget .	6 1 73 1 155 214 6 1 4 134 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 12 1 18 115 29 24 13 19 0 1 12 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 10

It all seemed innocent enough : Last April , one Steven B. Iken visited Justin Products Inc. here , identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new cassette players for children .	23 16 28 126 1 104 137 76 2 0 0 0 1 11 0 0 1 123 2 73 23 7 6 0 1 13 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 42 0 0 1 12 1 10
It is almost identical to the Sony product , Mr. Iken remarked , after seeing prototypes and pictures .	23 28 29 53 7 6 0 1 2 0 1 27 2 612 32 1 13 1 10
Replied a Justin salesman : Exactly .	242 6 0 1 106 185 10
The Justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40 % below those of Sony Corp. of Japan 's My First Sony line .	6 0 1 11 0 1 6 0 1 142 23 12 0 1 12 1 42 36 36 0 1 10
The visitor waxed enthusiastic and promised to return .	6 1 34 24 13 64 18 79 10
But instead of a new customer -- part of a hoped-for bonanza from underselling Sony -- Justin got a costly legal morass .	76 137 59 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 93 32 1 106 1 11 6 0 0 1 10
Mr. Iken , it turned out , was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for Sony .	0 1 2 23 44 35 2 11 6 0 1 229 6 0 0 1 18 19 1 38 1 10

Seeking to keep Justin 's My Own product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law .	113 18 19 1 42 36 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 2 1 72 16 11 6 1 38 0 0 1 32 6 1 12 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 12 0 1 10

His company -LRB- annual sales : about $ 25 million -RRB- may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated 10 % of total sales -- if Sony -LRB- annual sales : about $ 16 billion -RRB- prevails .	6 1 12 0 1 12 0 86 0 9 167 4 19 6 0 1 57 32 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 106 30 1 12 0 1 12 0 86 0 9 167 34 10

With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business .	59 0 1 2 6 1 16 162 336 24 1 20 139 6 1 7 0 1 10
Americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look-alike products from Japan .	1 64 18 87 35 155 182 40 38 0 1 12 1 10
Now Sony , whose innovative , premium-priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap look-alike produced in China .	76 1 2 135 0 2 0 1 48 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 37 16 45 7 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 40 38 1 10
The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it , says Lewis H. Eslinger , Sony 's attorney , who previously guarded Rubik 's Cube .	6 1 12 23 65 66 1 11 35 6 0 1 13 1 64 18 19 23 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 42 1 2 33 16 11 1 42 1 10
-LRB- Sony itself declines to comment . -RRB-	166 1 78 64 18 79 10 167
If Sony wins , Mr. Eslinger says , its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas .	39 1 34 2 0 1 34 2 6 0 1 4 154 18 154 18 19 6 1 35 10
At worst , he adds , They 'd have to grind them all up and throw them away .	320 148 2 23 44 2 23 4 154 18 221 23 23 35 13 19 23 35 10
Mr. Kaye denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on Sony in the marketplace .	0 1 11 6 1 42 1 13 44 6 0 1 37 32 35 1 38 6 1 10
I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper , he says .	23 11 6 0 1 13 23 11 23 35 2 23 27 10
Today , U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected to rule on Sony 's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products , on which deliveries began in July .	76 2 0 0 0 0 1 14 17 18 87 7 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 1 32 1 12 6 0 1 2 12 124 1 34 38 1 10
The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments .	6 1 11 35 6 0 0 1 12 52 6 1 38 6 1 40 38 1 106 13 1 34 38 0 1 13 1 10
Though hoping to settle the case , Justin vows to fight on , if necessary .	181 113 18 19 6 1 2 1 64 18 79 35 2 140 24 10
But the battle is more than Justin bargained for .	76 6 1 11 1 75 1 48 323 10
I had no idea I was getting in so deep , says Mr. Kaye , who founded Justin in 1982 .	23 11 6 255 23 37 120 35 67 35 2 56 0 1 2 33 11 1 38 1 10
Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to find he was bored .	0 1 20 21 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 13 60 2 16 18 215 23 28 24 10
With Justin , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong , beginning with Mickey Mouse radios .	59 1 2 23 37 32 1 13 1 40 35 38 0 1 2 120 38 0 0 1 10
The company has grown -- to about 40 employees , from four initially , Mr. Kaye says .	6 1 20 60 70 7 36 0 1 2 38 1 208 2 0 1 27 10
Justin has been profitable since 1986 , adds the official , who shares his office with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys .	1 20 164 24 38 1 2 56 6 1 2 33 73 6 1 7 0 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 10
Like many others , Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children .	59 0 1 2 0 1 11 1 38 1 30 1 2 85 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 11 6 0 1 13 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 0 0 1 13 11 6 36 36 0 1 12 1 10
The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models .	6 36 0 0 1 28 53 7 1 84 6 0 1 10
-LRB- In court papers , Sony says it has spent more than $ 3 million to promote the line , with resulting sales of over a million units . -RRB-	166 59 0 1 2 1 44 23 20 21 24 227 86 0 9 18 19 6 1 2 38 0 1 12 36 36 0 1 10 167
Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor .	1 11 6 0 0 1 2 13 0 1 65 66 6 1 11 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 10
His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color .	6 1 11 35 0 1 12 0 1 13 16 11 23 38 1 2 1 13 2 52 2 1 10
Sony uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin , on the theory that kids prefer these colors .	1 11 35 1 13 1 2 12 1 12 1 106 13 205 206 1 2 153 6 80 66 1 11 6 1 10
-LRB- To be successful , a product can be any color whatsoever , as long as it is fire-engine red , says Charles E. Baxley , Justin 's attorney . -RRB-	166 4 115 24 2 6 1 4 19 6 1 78 2 67 67 30 23 28 29 24 2 56 0 0 1 2 1 42 1 10 167
By last winter , Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed .	59 0 1 2 1 37 32 1 38 0 1 38 0 1 13 0 1 106 13 1 34 10
Indeed , concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable Sony products -- against Justin 's customers , Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April .	76 2 351 66 0 0 1 37 32 0 1 13 0 1 106 69 93 32 0 0 1 106 12 1 42 1 2 0 1 11 35 6 1 12 1 38 1 10
He himself threatened to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department .	23 78 64 18 5 6 1 7 6 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 10
But Justin has n't pursued those charges -LRB- which were without merit , according to Mr. Eslinger , the Sony attorney -RRB- .	76 1 20 35 21 6 1 166 33 48 7 1 2 70 7 0 1 2 6 0 1 167 10
Recalls Mr. Baxley : Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone .	271 0 1 106 6 1 64 18 134 23 18 178 23 24 10
We never intended taking on Sony -- we do n't have the resources .	23 16 37 32 35 1 104 23 4 35 19 6 1 10
Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit .	1 73 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 10
Off and on since then , the companies have skirmished in court .	76 13 76 109 24 2 6 1 20 60 38 1 10
And Justin , in a news release , says , Once competitive , Sony now resorts to strong-arm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets .	76 1 2 85 6 0 1 2 44 2 29 24 2 1 16 48 7 0 1 38 0 1 18 19 35 13 19 0 1 10
Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters .	1 42 1 65 66 6 1 42 1 106 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 45 7 6 1 106 28 24 38 52 1 10
He also insists that Sony , no less than others , has a legal right to protect its trade dress , in this case , mostly the colors that it claims make My First Sony products distinctive .	23 16 65 66 1 2 72 16 487 1 2 11 6 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 2 295 6 1 2 69 92 1 138 23 232 136 0 0 1 78 24 10
-LRB- Justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children 's market . -RRB-	166 1 44 23 37 32 6 0 1 38 0 1 12 1 67 30 1 11 6 1 42 1 10 167
Whatever its merits , Sony 's aggressive defense is debilitating for Justin .	59 6 1 2 1 42 0 1 28 53 7 1 10
It 's also costly .	23 28 35 24 10
Mr. Kaye says he has paid more than $ 70,000 in legal fees so far .	0 1 44 23 20 21 24 227 86 9 12 0 1 67 35 10
Of Sony , Mr. Kaye says : They know there 's no way for them to lose .	59 1 2 0 1 44 106 23 44 50 51 6 1 100 23 18 79 10
They just keep digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away .	23 16 37 327 23 35 24 30 23 11 6 1 75 23 34 35 13 34 35 10

Giant , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , collection of companies that is controlled by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman , did n't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline , and Aspen officials could n't be reached for comment .	1 2 6 36 36 2 0 2 1 12 1 33 14 40 38 0 0 0 1 2 4 35 19 6 1 93 32 6 1 18 19 6 1 2 13 0 1 4 35 74 22 7 1 10

AGF did n't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval , but people close to the group said it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future , should interesting price opportunities arise .	1 4 35 87 35 7 6 1 93 32 6 1 2 13 1 24 84 6 1 44 23 14 40 18 115 285 6 1 4 19 6 1 18 19 6 1 12 6 1 2 437 0 0 1 79 10

This calamity is far from over , he says .	6 1 28 53 46 24 2 23 34 10

Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could find .	76 2 23 16 4 19 6 1 42 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 30 1 64 18 19 1 38 6 0 1 23 4 19 10

For example , the price of Southland Corp.

The outlook looks shaky because we 're still waiting for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors , says King Penniman , senior vice president at McCarthy , Crisanti & Maffei , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services .	6 1 28 24 30 23 37 35 565 198 0 1 2 158 24 2 18 19 23 12 6 0 0 1 18 19 35 1 12 0 1 2 56 0 1 2 0 0 1 12 0 2 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 10

Friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly .	1 42 0 1 12 1 20 35 60 38 6 1 12 1 33 11 0 1 67 70 7 6 0 0 1 2 13 1 20 151 22 7 1 18 178 1 29 24 10
Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked by Washington .	76 2 6 1 28 29 29 24 104 59 52 6 1 2 6 1 14 40 38 1 10
The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt .	6 1 12 6 1 64 18 77 66 6 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 13 23 28 29 285 6 1 34 67 38 6 0 0 1 10

This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut .	6 1 11 23 38 6 1 12 1 120 38 6 0 0 1 67 38 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 93 32 6 0 0 0 1 10
The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not ordinary income -RRB- .	6 0 1 12 6 1 2 85 23 2 14 16 40 38 6 1 12 6 1 140 116 149 1 24 11 6 1 12 1 12 1 33 44 1 11 35 0 1 167 10
And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month .	76 0 1 16 20 151 40 38 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 69 78 10
An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut .	6 1 567 1 42 1 2 6 1 14 22 7 6 0 1 2 111 23 7 86 0 9 12 0 1 38 6 0 0 1 10

Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect .	39 0 1 20 67 35 21 23 35 38 0 1 2 1 12 6 0 1 28 24 10
Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco .	76 270 104 0 1 20 151 40 38 6 0 1 10

But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes .	76 6 1 11 35 6 0 1 2 15 0 1 12 0 71 1 1 2 33 64 18 215 1 4 74 40 30 1 13 0 1 11 1 38 1 33 11 1 10
Worse , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon .	76 2 1 20 94 18 79 38 6 0 1 10
James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids .	0 1 2 6 0 1 33 11 6 36 36 13 36 36 0 0 1 2 20 139 6 0 0 1 7 0 1 130 66 23 4 74 40 38 1 18 19 6 0 13 0 0 0 1 10
It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to review any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more .	23 4 639 0 1 36 36 0 1 18 19 6 1 12 0 1 69 78 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 12 86 0 9 69 78 10

For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass .	59 23 113 18 215 6 1 12 0 1 34 106 38 1 12 1 42 0 1 12 0 1 13 0 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 106 50 51 0 0 0 1 104 6 1 78 32 0 0 0 0 1 13 6 0 0 1 48 7 1 120 38 6 0 1 10

The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center-right New Democracy Party , headed by Constantine Mitsotakis .	6 0 0 0 1 33 48 7 0 1 11 2 38 1 2 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 1 106 637 0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 2 40 38 0 1 10
On the other , the so-called Coalition of the Left and Progress -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro-Communist cousin , the Hellenic Left .	646 6 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 1 13 1 12 6 0 13 36 0 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 1 13 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 10

In point of fact , this catharsis was overdue by decades .	59 1 12 1 2 6 1 28 24 84 1 10

With regard to Greece 's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal , Mr. Papandreou 's principal accuser remains George Koskotas , former owner of the Bank of Crete and self-confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in Salem , Mass. , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece .	59 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 2 0 1 42 0 1 11 0 1 2 0 1 12 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 2 16 120 38 6 0 1 12 1 2 1 2 12 124 23 37 32 0 1 33 4 5 23 7 1 10

Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched .	7 0 1 802 55 0 1 11 86 0 9 12 0 0 71 1 1 13 6 0 86 9 12 1 2 223 40 91 55 6 0 1 82 0 1 18 19 6 86 0 9 38 0 1 42 1 13 16 19 35 6 1 91 13 2 339 1 42 1 11 38 6 86 0 9 0 1 11 10
Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court .	0 0 1 648 116 29 24 38 6 0 1 66 0 1 12 1 64 18 5 23 7 6 0 1 10
But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers .	76 32 0 1 438 6 1 12 1 12 1 0 1 11 38 0 0 1 10
In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and indications that point to PASOK , not clinching proof .	59 6 1 2 6 1 11 52 0 1 13 1 33 48 7 1 2 78 69 78 10
On another issue , Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency , the EYP , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and PASOK cabinet members .	59 6 1 2 1 14 317 55 6 0 0 1 2 6 1 2 16 11 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 12 0 0 1 2 1 13 0 0 1 10
Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps .	59 0 1 2 23 14 35 351 66 0 1 16 11 13 11 6 1 10
The central weakness of the scandals debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks .	6 0 1 12 6 0 1 14 40 35 67 35 30 1 34 38 0 1 13 1 10
The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France 's Avions Marcel Dassault , respectively .	6 0 1 64 18 77 66 0 1 20 21 0 1 57 32 6 1 12 0 0 1 13 0 0 0 1 2 40 38 6 0 0 0 1 13 1 42 0 0 1 2 35 10
So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense .	76 23 65 66 0 1 13 6 0 1 4 163 16 114 0 1 6 0 1 12 6 1 104 1 2 158 24 13 24 2 4 35 19 6 1 111 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 38 0 1 42 1 10
But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated .	76 39 0 0 1 24 4 35 344 1 19 1 2 0 1 4 35 74 40 10
First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece .	24 145 6 0 1 104 23 44 6 1 12 6 1 13 1 20 21 35 6 0 1 57 120 38 6 0 1 40 57 32 1 13 32 6 1 12 1 12 1 10
Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner .	76 2 18 19 6 1 12 6 1 2 23 82 6 0 0 1 18 87 7 1 38 6 0 1 10
Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate .	76 2 23 64 18 19 6 1 106 23 12 361 28 53 7 6 0 1 42 1 106 57 606 7 1 6 0 0 0 1 10
For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis .	59 1 2 13 59 1 93 32 6 0 0 1 2 23 64 18 19 6 0 0 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 217 0 1 10
Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench , but also with seals of approval from representatives of its harshest accusers .	76 1 34 38 6 1 67 67 38 0 1 2 13 67 38 1 12 1 12 1 12 6 0 1 10
Crucial as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle .	76 694 6 1 48 7 1 2 0 1 12 1 37 156 53 7 6 1 10
The country 's future NATO participation remains unsure , for instance .	6 1 42 0 0 1 28 24 2 38 1 10
Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation .	1 16 4 19 0 1 12 1 38 1 12 6 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
Greece 's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well .	1 42 0 1 12 6 1 11 1 35 67 35 10
For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece lapses in May 1990 .	59 1 2 6 0 1 120 67 67 35 68 1 34 38 1 123 10
Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the June elections , but the clock is running .	1 12 6 0 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 2 13 6 1 37 120 10
Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid , a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight .	6 1 12 1 11 6 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 1 33 14 22 38 6 1 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 10
The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case , but the matter awaits final approval from Greece 's next justice minister .	6 0 1 20 60 38 1 12 1 38 6 0 1 2 13 6 1 11 0 1 12 1 42 0 0 1 10
The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism .	6 1 28 29 53 7 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 0 1 54 55 1 4 74 152 24 13 24 38 0 1 18 19 1 10
That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable ; the Greek press , previously eager to palm off PASOK 's line , has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild-eyed vengeance .	66 1 4 19 6 1 35 1292 24 91 6 0 1 2 29 43 18 19 35 1 42 1 2 20 60 38 0 1 38 6 0 1 10
Yet the possibility of another lash-up government is all too real .	76 6 1 12 6 0 1 28 29 29 24 10
If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader , he could hamstring a conservative-led coalition .	39 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 2 23 4 19 6 0 1 10
Also , he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March .	76 2 23 4 19 0 1 67 67 35 57 32 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 10
New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles .	0 1 20 67 35 16 21 6 1 13 139 6 0 1 7 0 1 12 1 2 113 18 87 7 52 0 1 13 6 1 12 0 1 10

He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage .	23 37 35 35 156 24 38 6 1 10
But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated .	76 39 23 11 35 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 33 16 11 1 2 192 193 29 24 18 5 23 46 24 2 13 29 29 29 24 10

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws .	6 0 0 1 12 0 1 65 66 1 4 35 178 0 1 53 7 0 0 1 12 0 1 30 6 0 1 16 11 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 10
The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. , claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the Lisa computer , introduced in 1983 .	6 1 48 7 6 0 1 40 38 1 12 0 0 1 2 207 66 0 1 73 1 7 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 40 38 1 10
Lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the press defense by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling .	1 120 38 0 1 44 23 28 266 66 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 4 115 24 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
According to the suit , Apple officials created public excitement by touting Lisa as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year .	122 7 6 1 2 0 1 11 0 1 57 111 1 7 6 0 1 33 4 19 6 1 13 115 29 24 38 6 0 1 10
The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare , the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with Lisa .	6 1 16 65 66 122 7 6 1 2 6 1 11 0 1 32 1 12 1 10
The suit claimed Apple 's stock climbed to a high of $ 63.50 a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts .	6 1 44 1 42 1 34 38 6 1 12 86 9 92 1 38 6 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 10
But when the company revealed Lisa 's poor sales late in 1983 , the stock plummeted to a low of $ 17.37 a share , according to the suit .	76 39 6 1 11 1 42 0 1 67 38 1 2 6 1 34 38 6 1 12 86 9 92 1 2 70 7 6 1 10
The shareholders claimed more than $ 150 million in losses .	6 1 11 24 227 86 0 9 12 1 10
In 1987 , the San Francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company 's statements by alerting consumers to Lisa 's problems .	59 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 11 6 1 67 30 0 1 20 16 21 6 1 42 1 57 111 1 7 1 42 1 10
Late last month , the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed .	137 137 76 2 6 0 1 65 66 1 12 6 1 4 74 40 10
However , it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to Lisa 's disk drive , known as Twiggy .	76 2 23 108 6 1 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 12 6 1 33 48 7 1 42 0 1 2 22 7 1 10
The court ruled that the news media did n't reveal Twiggy 's problems at the time .	6 1 65 66 6 0 1 4 35 19 1 42 1 38 6 1 10
Lawyers are worried about the ruling 's implication in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the Apple case .	1 14 22 7 6 1 42 1 12 0 0 1 13 351 35 66 6 1 65 66 6 1 4 74 22 46 29 53 7 6 0 1 10
The court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company 's statements , said Patrick Grannon , a Los Angeles lawyer at the firm of Greenfield & Chimicles , which was n't involved in the case .	6 1 28 43 18 77 66 6 0 1 48 7 6 36 0 1 13 11 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 0 1 2 33 14 35 40 38 6 1 10

Mr. Goldfein , of Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom in New York , says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the USFL lost its major claims , including its contention that the NFL restrained trade through television contracts .	0 1 2 12 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 44 6 1 28 24 13 6 0 1 28 24 104 6 1 11 6 0 1 2 12 6 80 66 6 1 11 1 38 0 1 10

Still , it said it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the order of 20 billion francs , reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year .	76 2 23 44 23 82 1 12 23 12 1 18 87 7 6 1 12 36 0 1 2 32 0 1 12 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 1 10

Mr. Simmons said the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products , which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower-priced , imported steel .	0 1 44 6 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 12 1 13 0 1 2 33 20 94 18 115 24 38 6 1 12 0 2 0 1 10
A new $ 46 million steel rod minimill , which got off to a rocky start in early 1988 , now is running efficiently and a new management team is more heavily marketing Keystone 's products , Mr. Simmons said .	6 0 125 0 9 0 0 1 2 33 48 35 7 6 0 1 38 0 1 2 16 37 120 35 13 6 0 0 1 37 72 16 32 1 42 1 2 0 1 27 10
As a result , the company hopes to report net income for the year of about $ 11.6 million , or about $ 3.10 to $ 3.15 a share , compared with a net loss of $ 24.4 million last year , after a loss from discontinued operations of $ 18.4 million .	59 6 1 2 6 1 64 18 19 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 86 0 9 2 13 0 86 9 12 86 9 92 1 2 230 7 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 402 250 2 12 6 1 12 0 1 12 86 0 9 10

Production at the mill has exceeded the ability of Keystone 's casting operation to supply it , he said , which will force Keystone to purchase billet , or unfinished steel bars , from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year .	1 12 6 1 20 21 6 1 12 1 42 0 1 18 19 23 2 23 44 2 90 4 134 1 18 5 1 2 13 0 0 1 2 161 7 6 1 38 6 0 1 13 67 35 10
Keystone will have to consider expanding its casting operation , at an estimated cost of $ 8 million to $ 10 million , within the next 18 to 24 months , Mr. Simmons said .	1 4 154 18 168 32 6 0 1 2 38 6 0 1 12 86 0 9 132 86 0 9 2 38 6 0 0 228 0 1 2 0 1 27 10

Prior to a year ago , Keystone was an order-taker .	122 46 6 1 3 2 1 11 6 1 10
Now I think we have a group of marketing people who are out selling to retailers and wholesalers , Mr. Simmons said .	76 23 44 23 11 6 1 12 0 1 33 1237 24 45 7 1 13 1 2 0 1 27 10

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium-recovery facility in Donaldsonville , La. , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit .	0 1 44 6 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 12 1 2 1 2 4 87 7 0 0 1 12 52 0 1 13 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10
The company did n't elaborate .	6 1 4 35 79 10
The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant , but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves .	6 0 0 13 0 1 65 66 6 0 0 1 28 53 7 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 13 66 6 1 4 74 40 35 30 6 1 34 10

Over the weeked , however , two developments in other deals indicated that commerical banks and Wall Street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies .	59 6 1 2 76 2 0 1 12 0 1 65 66 0 1 13 0 0 1 16 28 43 18 19 1 12 1 18 19 0 1 40 38 0 1 10
Vitro S.A. , a major Mexican glass maker , said yesterday that it agreed to buy Anchor Glass Container in a tender offer for $ 21.25 a share , sweetened from the original $ 20-a-share offer Vitro launched two months ago .	0 1 2 6 0 0 0 1 2 65 35 66 23 64 18 19 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 12 86 9 92 1 2 22 7 6 0 125 9 1 1 11 0 1 26 10

For the broader market , the greatest significance of the Vitro-Anchor deal may be that it was put together late Friday night -- after the market rout -- and involves a $ 155 million temporary bridge loan from Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities and a $ 139 million loan from Security Pacific National Bank .	59 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 4 77 66 23 14 152 24 67 67 35 106 38 6 0 1 106 13 11 6 125 0 9 0 0 1 12 0 2 0 0 0 1 13 6 125 0 9 1 12 0 0 0 1 10
Moreover , to complete the entire Anchor Glass purchase and refinance existing debt , Donaldson said it is highly confident that it will be able to sell $ 400 million of junk bonds for Vitro , despite the current disarray in the junk bond market .	76 2 18 19 6 0 0 0 1 13 19 0 1 2 1 44 23 28 29 266 66 23 4 115 43 18 19 86 0 9 12 0 1 38 1 2 38 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 10
Donaldson 's statement is n't merely an idle boast , because those bonds will have to be sold before Donaldson 's bridge loan can be paid back .	1 42 1 11 35 52 6 0 1 2 30 6 1 4 154 18 74 40 30 1 42 0 1 4 74 40 35 10

In another takeover battle , a spokesman for McCaw Cellular Communications said yesterday that McCaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain highly confident they can arrange $ 4.5 billion of bank loans for McCaw 's tender offer for about 45 % of LIN Broadcasting , notwithstanding recent events .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 12 0 0 1 65 35 66 1 20 151 351 38 0 0 1 66 23 28 29 285 23 4 19 86 0 9 12 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 12 36 0 1 12 0 1 2 38 0 1 10
McCaw is offering $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares , thereby challenging LIN 's proposal to spin off its television properties , pay shareholders a $ 20-a-share special dividend and combine its cellular-telephone operations with BellSouth 's cellular business .	1 37 111 86 9 92 1 7 36 0 0 1 2 16 32 1 42 1 18 19 35 6 0 1 2 221 1 6 125 9 0 1 13 5 6 0 1 7 1 42 0 1 10

In the past , corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO firms , which were often prepared to outbid the corporations , says J.

Shares of American Medical International , which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago , fell 15.8 % on Friday to close at 20 .	1 12 0 0 1 2 33 64 67 35 18 5 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 33 11 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 1 2 64 67 35 38 1 18 87 7 1 10
The buy-out group is offering $ 26.50 a share for 63 million American Medical shares , down from its offer in July of $ 28 a share for 68.8 million shares .	6 0 1 37 111 86 9 92 1 7 36 0 0 0 1 2 70 7 6 1 12 1 12 86 9 92 1 12 36 0 1 10

Hilton Hotels , for example , was among the worst-hit issues , falling 20.2 % to close at 85 , down 21 1\/2 on Friday .	0 1 2 85 1 2 48 7 6 0 1 2 113 67 35 18 87 7 1 2 38 0 1 38 1 10

People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in Hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing .	1 24 84 1 65 38 6 1 66 6 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 28 24 30 1 12 6 0 1 4 115 53 7 0 1 10
However , they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers .	76 2 23 65 66 6 0 1 4 79 38 0 1 13 4 74 40 30 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 11 6 0 1 12 1 18 5 1 7 0 1 10
Hilton officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock .	0 1 44 23 28 35 53 7 6 1 12 6 1 42 1 10
William Lebo , Hilton 's general counsel , said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are on track for what has been described previously as a slow and deliberate process .	0 1 2 1 42 0 1 2 44 1 18 19 6 1 12 6 1 13 23 12 6 1 48 7 1 212 118 20 151 22 35 7 6 0 13 0 1 10
I ca n't believe that any potential buyer for Hilton would be affected by one day 's trading , Mr. Lebo said .	23 4 35 77 66 6 0 1 12 1 4 74 40 38 0 1 42 1 2 0 1 27 10
But the stock market as a whole , bolstered as it is by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers , both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks .	76 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 40 30 23 34 38 0 1 2 28 53 7 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 69 12 6 0 1 13 12 0 1 10
For debt-ridden suitors , the takeover game has been over for some time , says New York money manager Neil Weisman of Chilmark Capital , who has been keeping 85 % of his portfolio in cash .	59 0 1 2 6 0 1 20 164 24 38 6 1 2 56 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 20 121 111 0 1 12 6 1 7 1 10

Of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease .	59 52 6 0 1 40 38 6 1 13 0 1 2 1 28 24 13 24 171 84 6 1 12 0 1 13 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms .	18 5 0 1 7 6 0 1 12 6 1 2 76 2 6 1 13 0 1 4 19 1 238 19 6 0 0 1 13 0 1 10
It must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective .	23 4 35 5 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 7 6 0 1 10
Specifically , it must understand how real-estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .	76 2 23 4 194 55 0 1 48 7 1 12 0 1 13 16 5 1 7 6 1 10
When a regional economy catches cold , the local real-estate market gets pneumonia .	39 6 0 1 11 1 2 6 0 0 1 11 1 10
In other words , real-estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession .	59 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 69 12 0 1 13 0 1 2 34 67 35 68 6 0 1 12 1 10
This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York .	23 14 40 38 6 0 1 38 0 1 13 81 1 38 0 1 10
But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy .	76 6 1 28 35 24 104 39 6 1 42 1 48 7 6 1 2 6 0 1 4 79 67 35 68 6 0 1 10
Why do local real-estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ?	243 244 0 0 1 87 7 0 0 1 10
Because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .	346 0 1 13 1 11 52 0 0 1 75 0 1 13 1 11 6 1 67 140 53 7 0 0 1 13 1 10
Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment .	0 1 14 40 35 35 38 6 0 1 2 30 6 0 0 1 11 6 0 0 1 13 1 10
Area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % .	0 1 34 38 0 1 38 6 0 1 13 0 1 28 126 0 1 10
However , the real-estate market was hurt even more .	76 2 6 0 1 14 40 67 35 10
For example , residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level .	59 1 2 0 0 1 85 6 0 1 12 1 28 126 0 1 84 6 0 0 1 10
Once metropolitan Detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s , real estate rebounded .	39 0 1 42 1 34 38 6 1 2 0 1 34 10
Building permits , for example , soared a staggering 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 .	0 1 2 85 1 2 11 6 0 0 1 637 1 13 6 0 1 12 1 10
Where , savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ?	1186 2 0 0 13 0 1 37 35 120 2 242 1 42 1 10
Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation .	115 29 24 84 0 1 13 1 2 1 12 6 36 0 2 0 13 0 210 0 1 12 6 1 10
Of course , some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play .	59 1 2 6 1 20 139 1 13 1 38 6 0 0 1 7 6 0 1 10
But now appears to be the time to act .	76 1 64 18 19 6 1 18 79 10
Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak .	0 1 42 1 4 79 13 16 79 38 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
In the mid-1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % .	59 6 1 2 1 28 126 366 24 7 0 1 84 6 0 1 13 0 1 28 126 0 1 10
The real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks .	6 0 1 11 88 36 0 1 10
Office construction dropped 97 % .	0 1 34 67 35 10
The vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant .	6 0 1 34 24 304 67 35 38 36 0 0 1 2 13 24 25 0 1 12 0 1 28 24 10
To some observers , the empty office buildings of Houston 's see-through skyline were indicative of a very troubled economy .	59 6 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 42 0 1 28 53 7 6 36 0 1 10
As usual , the real-estate market had overreacted .	109 24 2 6 0 1 20 60 10
Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation .	76 2 6 1 42 1 11 6 0 1 10
Metropolitan Houston 's population has held steady over the past six years .	0 1 42 1 20 164 24 38 6 0 0 1 10
And personal income , after slumping in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms .	76 0 1 2 211 120 38 6 1 2 20 169 7 6 0 1 12 0 0 1 10
Today , metropolitan Houston 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround .	76 2 0 1 42 0 1 28 53 7 6 0 1 10
More than 42,000 jobs were added in metro Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry .	24 227 1 78 14 40 38 0 1 67 35 2 67 38 1 2 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 10
This growth puts Houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year .	6 1 73 1 7 6 0 0 0 1 12 6 1 69 78 10
And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average .	76 1 11 6 36 0 228 36 0 0 1 12 1 12 6 0 0 1 12 62 52 6 0 1 10
Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston .	1 11 6 0 1 75 6 0 0 1 20 169 7 6 1 42 0 1 2 30 1 20 35 21 62 52 6 0 1 12 1 10
By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years .	59 6 1 2 0 1 42 1 20 35 60 38 6 0 0 1 10
Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle .	6 1 20 94 18 79 38 1 2 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
Employment is now 4 % higher than in 1983 .	1 28 35 116 29 24 213 7 1 10
Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 -LRB- the most recent year available -RRB- .	0 1 12 0 1 16 34 67 35 637 1 13 1 12 6 36 0 1 24 167 10
The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy .	6 1 12 1 2 16 2 11 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 13 23 20 169 7 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 10
In a self-fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years .	59 6 0 1 2 76 2 6 1 42 0 1 72 16 34 38 0 1 10
Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks .	0 0 1 28 126 24 25 0 1 84 6 0 1 10
Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real-estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport .	39 6 1 4 194 55 0 1 42 0 1 4 79 2 0 0 0 1 32 0 0 1 48 7 1 13 40 67 67 38 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 32 6 0 1 2 13 6 0 0 1 10
When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound .	39 1 42 0 1 64 18 79 35 30 52 6 1 4 79 67 70 7 0 1 106 1 13 0 1 4 79 2 13 6 0 1 12 0 1 4 19 6 0 0 1 10
What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ?	454 0 1 244 1 19 38 6 0 1 135 0 1 28 35 29 1293 18 19 7 0 1 13 0 1 10
Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles .	76 2 1 12 0 0 1 37 120 38 6 0 1 2 79 38 52 36 0 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 10
Vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years .	0 1 12 6 36 0 228 36 0 1 16 4 16 79 38 6 36 863 36 0 1 38 6 1 12 1 10
Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- catching cold -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia .	59 6 1 2 52 6 1 123 12 0 1 93 32 1 106 12 6 0 0 1 4 19 0 1 12 1 13 0 0 1 45 7 1 30 6 0 1 11 1 10
Those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term -LRB- three-year -RRB- lease and wait for the bargains ahead .	23 45 7 0 1 38 0 0 1 4 19 35 1 13 79 35 91 23 120 38 0 0 1 4 19 6 0 526 24 167 1 13 87 7 6 1 78 10

Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency .	0 1 11 35 6 1 12 6 125 0 9 0 0 1 111 23 155 32 35 1 12 6 0 1 23 11 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 13 32 23 38 1 10
Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause .	0 1 11 23 38 6 1 12 0 1 33 14 40 38 6 0 0 0 1 38 1 30 0 1 106 1229 18 79 309 55 6 0 1 85 6 1 82 0 0 1 18 19 35 6 1 10

In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln .	59 6 36 0 1 12 0 1 42 1 12 1 123 2 6 0 1 82 0 1 18 79 35 38 1 10
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was a ticking time bomb .	122 7 1 40 38 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 44 1 37 45 35 7 1 42 36 0 1 13 11 6 0 0 1 10
Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous .	0 1 20 174 66 6 1 37 156 29 24 10
The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations grossly unfair , and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was viable and profitable .	6 1 65 66 0 1 136 6 0 0 0 0 1 42 1 29 24 2 13 66 0 1 65 66 0 1 42 1 28 24 13 24 10
For the next two years , the Bank Board , which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent .	59 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 1 2 33 85 6 1 11 6 1 24 399 32 1 2 64 18 79 409 76 346 0 1 65 38 1 123 66 0 1 20 195 1 18 115 24 10

In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign , Sen.

But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted .	76 0 1 44 0 1 11 35 6 1 35 38 1 2 30 6 1 64 18 19 6 0 1 42 1 67 35 117 0 1 34 10

In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen.

In addition , Sen.

Sen. Cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act .	0 1 2 33 20 35 139 6 1 7 6 0 1 12 1 38 6 1 12 0 1 2 73 6 1 12 1 7 1294 1 18 79 10

When China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979 , toy makers from Hong Kong were among the first to march in .	39 1 73 6 1 7 0 1 38 1 2 0 1 12 0 1 48 7 6 1 18 79 35 10
Today , with about 75 % of the companies ' products being made in China , the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council , Dennis Ting , has suggested a new sourcing label : Made in China by Hong Kong Companies .	76 2 347 36 0 1 12 6 1 42 1 182 40 38 1 2 6 1 12 6 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 20 21 6 0 0 1 196 40 38 1 38 0 0 1 10

But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June 4 , the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China .	76 59 6 1 12 6 1 12 1 12 86 9 2 6 0 0 0 1 37 45 7 6 0 1 12 1 10

Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China .	6 1 14 35 40 38 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 12 0 1 10
By diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers say .	181 32 0 1 2 6 0 1 4 35 154 18 87 7 1 2 1 13 0 1 27 10

A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site .	6 1 12 0 1 13 6 1 12 0 1 42 1 2 1 2 1 13 0 1 2 704 217 0 1 2 20 114 1 42 0 1 6 0 0 1 10

Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc .	1 12 1 34 67 30 0 1 42 0 1 37 45 7 6 0 0 1 13 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 0 71 1 1 13 0 0 1 10
Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .	0 0 1 44 0 0 1 13 0 0 1 45 7 6 0 1 11 6 0 1 2 229 23 18 19 0 1 13 0 1 10

Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. Kwan said the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates .	703 1 154 18 115 24 38 6 0 1 2 33 48 7 36 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 44 6 0 1 4 221 1 6 0 0 1 12 1 10

The Bush administration , urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions , said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents .	6 0 1 2 229 6 0 1 18 221 1 0 1 18 19 1 2 44 1 11 35 6 1 12 1 12 6 1 12 6 1 10

The administration 's position was outlined in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term .	6 1 42 1 14 40 38 6 0 1 40 38 1 12 0 0 1 6 0 1 4 191 40 13 4 19 81 1 10
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion .	6 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 32 6 0 1 33 298 299 6 1 12 6 1 74 40 30 23 4 19 6 1 10
The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions .	6 1 82 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 317 38 52 52 0 1 67 35 55 6 0 1 11 1 42 0 1 10
Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a reasonable justification for adopting it .	59 6 1 2 33 11 6 1 12 0 1 217 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 12 1 28 24 30 6 1 11 6 0 1 93 32 23 10
That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a compelling reason for restricting abortion .	23 11 6 36 0 1 710 6 1 18 19 12 6 0 1 42 1 12 1 2 33 82 6 1 18 19 6 0 1 93 32 1 10
On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead .	59 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 6 0 1 65 66 364 299 6 1 74 40 11 6 0 1 2 13 66 50 51 6 1 18 19 6 1 33 82 1 18 79 38 1 38 6 1 42 1 35 10

Excluding the higher tax rate , which rose two percentage points to 38 % , and the negative exchange rate adjustment , the company would have met analysts ' expectations , said R.

Noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's slowest , Mr. Atwell added , the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway .	207 66 6 0 1 11 35 6 0 1 78 78 2 0 1 44 2 6 0 1 11 35 6 0 0 1 38 23 35 10
Nevertheless , the company said shipments were up slightly to 679,000 metric tons from 671,000 , buffing the impact of the unexpected earning decline .	76 2 6 1 44 1 28 29 24 84 0 0 1 84 1 2 32 6 1 12 6 0 0 1 10

For 20 years , federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business .	59 0 1 2 0 1 20 139 6 0 0 0 1 155 120 38 1 12 6 36 0 13 0 1 12 6 0 1 10
And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that .	76 59 0 1 2 1 2 1 13 1 20 169 7 0 1 38 6 0 1 18 19 23 10
But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever .	76 347 0 1 32 35 0 0 1 2 6 1 37 32 6 1 35 495 24 10
They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air .	23 44 6 0 1 4 19 6 0 1 13 134 1 18 87 155 32 0 1 33 73 6 1 155 32 6 1 12 0 1 13 32 1 12 6 1 23 73 7 6 1 10
Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon .	0 0 1 2 16 2 65 35 66 1 106 69 12 1 13 12 1 12 6 1 106 28 29 24 6 1 26 10
And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the fin-syn provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules .	76 76 6 1 16 37 45 7 0 1 18 19 6 0 1 2 22 35 7 6 0 0 13 0 1 10
That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co. , backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co. , had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd. 's now-scuttled $ 1.5 billion bid for MGM\/UA Communications Co .	23 28 24 67 35 38 6 80 66 0 0 1 2 40 38 6 0 1 12 0 0 0 1 2 20 94 18 544 11 0 0 1 42 0 125 0 9 1 12 0 0 1 10
NBC 's interest may revive the deal , which MGM\/UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash .	1 42 1 4 19 6 1 2 138 1 11 67 35 30 6 0 1 11 1 32 1 10
Even if that deal is n't revived , NBC hopes to find another .	137 39 6 1 14 35 40 2 1 64 18 19 23 10
Our doors are open , an NBC spokesman says .	6 1 28 24 2 6 0 1 27 10
NBC may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a program-maker without violating the rules .	1 4 35 19 6 1 18 19 6 0 2 0 1 12 6 1 57 32 6 1 10
And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC 's parent , Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , to look for ways of skirting the fin-syn regulations .	76 6 0 1 4 134 0 1 13 1 42 1 2 0 0 1 2 18 87 7 1 93 32 6 0 1 10
But the networks ' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios .	76 6 1 42 1 4 35 19 6 36 0 1 12 23 13 0 1 10
Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin-syn restraints .	6 1 64 18 79 35 67 35 38 52 6 1 54 55 23 4 87 155 32 0 1 10
Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge .	0 1 24 84 6 1 82 6 1 18 79 10
The networks still are uninhibited in their authority over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules .	6 1 16 28 53 7 6 1 12 456 1 34 38 6 1 2 56 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 6 36 0 1 93 32 6 1 10
Studios are powerless to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends .	1 28 43 18 19 1 38 0 1 13 19 23 35 67 500 18 87 7 0 0 1 2 23 27 10
And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says .	76 23 162 55 6 1 2 85 6 0 1 2 4 79 38 1 2 23 27 10
Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed .	0 1 230 7 6 1 106 12 1 12 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 13 0 1 106 64 18 74 40 10
But Mr. Valenti , who represents the studios , asserts : The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving the rules .	76 0 1 2 33 11 6 1 2 44 106 6 0 0 1 2 12 6 1 2 48 7 6 1 93 32 6 1 10
Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend .	52 1 136 0 1 116 149 1 266 66 6 1 4 79 10
They do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate , says one network executive .	23 4 35 154 18 19 6 1 18 79 2 56 0 0 1 10
And there 's no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules .	76 50 51 6 80 66 1 28 43 18 19 6 1 10
That 's the problem , is n't it ?	23 11 6 1 2 1179 185 23 10
Indeed it is .	76 23 34 10
Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise .	1 20 173 35 23 11 6 1 12 6 1 2 229 6 1 13 6 1 2 33 11 1 12 0 1 40 38 6 1 2 18 19 35 6 0 1 10
But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive .	76 0 1 20 170 6 1 106 13 0 0 0 1 2 158 24 106 116 29 266 66 6 1 4 115 24 18 79 10
The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million .	6 0 1 12 0 1 42 1 18 5 0 0 0 1 7 86 0 9 2 13 18 5 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 86 0 9 10
I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony\/Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo , wrote J.B. Holston , an NBC vice president , in a commentary in last week 's issue of Broadcasting magazine .	23 11 563 0 1 4 79 38 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 12 0 1 40 35 38 1 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 2 153 6 1 153 0 1 42 1 12 0 1 10
-LRB- He did n't mention that NBC , in the meantime , was hoping to assist Australia 's Qintex in buying	166 23 4 35 77 66 1 2 85 6 1 2 37 113 18 5 1 42 1 7 1
An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston 's lament was entirely consistent with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks .	6 0 1 65 66 0 1 42 1 28 29 53 7 0 1 30 6 0 1 4 19 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 67 35 264 18 87 0 1 161 372 6 1 12 0 1 24 84 1 106 13 23 78 12 6 0 1 10
The Big Three 's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner .	6 1 123 42 1 12 1 37 120 38 6 1 30 6 0 0 1 48 35 7 1 18 19 1 10
Although Time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely unregulated pay-cable channel , Home Box Office , own the Warner movies aired on HBO -- a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin-syn regulations .	39 1 16 11 6 0 1 18 5 1 7 1 2 6 1 4 344 1 42 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 19 6 0 1 40 38 1 38 6 0 1 33 14 16 40 38 0 1 10
NBC 's Mr. Wright led the way in decrying the networks ' inability to match a Time-Warner combination .	1 42 0 1 11 6 1 57 32 6 1 42 1 18 19 6 0 1 10
He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced .	23 34 35 35 30 6 0 1 12 1 14 40 10
Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM\/UA was disclosed , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment .	39 1 42 1 12 6 0 1 12 1 14 40 2 0 1 20 35 164 53 7 1 10
With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into uncharted territory -- possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington .	59 6 0 1 2 1 4 79 38 0 1 57 16 32 1 12 6 1 13 12 1 10
It 's never really been tested , says William Lilley III , who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted .	23 34 35 16 14 40 2 56 0 0 1 2 33 85 6 0 0 1 235 1 113 18 419 6 1 60 10
He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , consulting to media companies .	23 16 11 0 1 12 1 2 45 7 0 1 10
Fin-syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy .	0 1 4 35 16 5 6 1 155 32 6 0 2 0 1 12 6 1 33 48 7 6 0 1 1 4 35 19 10
Hence , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM\/UA .	76 2 1 4 115 43 18 79 2 79 2 6 36 0 1 12 6 1 69 12 1 10
If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake .	39 6 1 11 1 2 6 1 42 0 1 4 74 40 35 38 6 0 1 12 124 6 1 4 35 19 6 0 1 10

Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a 100%-owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime\/comedy Moonlighting -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations .	59 0 1 2 137 39 6 1 28 24 38 6 0 1 30 1 2 85 1 2 11 6 1 57 32 6 0 0 1 106 23 14 35 17 18 79 38 6 0 1 30 6 1 14 22 7 0 1 10
Instead , ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee .	76 2 1 4 154 18 5 35 6 1 7 6 0 1 10

Various evidence , including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged .	0 1 2 12 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 138 6 1 20 21 13 20 16 21 38 6 1 2 44 6 1 4 35 19 0 1 38 6 1 223 742 151 40 10

In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue .	59 1 2 6 1 34 104 23 48 7 1 2 52 0 1 2 13 1 11 1 12 1 38 6 0 1 12 1 13 1 32 6 1 10

On Friday , Andrew S.Grove , Intel president and chief executive officer , said Intel 's business is strong .	59 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 13 0 0 1 2 44 1 42 1 28 24 10
Our bookings improved as the quarter progressed and September was especially good .	6 1 34 30 6 1 34 13 1 28 29 24 10
For the full quarter , our bookings were higher than the previous quarter , and our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1.0 .	59 6 0 1 2 6 1 28 24 84 6 0 1 2 13 6 0 1 11 1 10
For the nine-month period , Intel reported net of $ 268.3 million , or $ 1.43 a share , down 27 % from $ 367.1 million , or $ 2.05 a share .	59 6 0 1 2 1 11 1 12 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 2 256 0 1 7 86 0 9 2 13 86 9 92 1 10
Revenue amounted to $ 2.23 billion , up slightly from $ 2.15 billion .	1 48 7 86 0 9 2 69 230 7 86 0 9 10
Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday .	0 1 13 6 0 0 1 34 35 35 10
After 26 years in prison , Mr. Sisulu , the 77-year-old former secretary-general of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up .	59 0 1 12 1 2 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 14 40 35 38 6 1 38 6 0 1 42 1 67 30 6 1 37 120 35 10
At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their families at various places around the country .	59 6 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 23 12 361 14 40 38 23 38 1 13 22 7 0 1 2 14 22 7 6 1 38 0 1 12 6 1 10
And as the graying men returned to their homes , the ANC , outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships .	76 39 6 0 1 48 7 6 1 2 6 1 2 40 38 0 1 38 1 13 16 17 18 19 6 0 0 1 38 6 0 1 2 16 34 38 6 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 10
A huge ANC flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts , caps and scarves .	6 0 0 1 2 12 0 2 0 13 0 1 2 14 40 38 6 0 1 12 0 1 42 0 1 2 30 59 6 1 59 1 2 1 11 6 0 1 38 6 1 2 1 13 1 10
At the small four-room home of Elias Motsoaledi , a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe , well-wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons .	59 6 0 0 1 12 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 13 6 0 1 12 6 1 42 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 1 11 0 0 1 38 6 1 13 6 1 34 38 6 0 1 40 38 0 1 10
I am happy to see the spirit of the people , said Mr. Sisulu , looking dapper in a new gray suit .	23 28 43 18 19 6 1 12 6 1 2 56 0 1 2 156 53 7 6 0 0 1 10
As the crowd outside his home shouted ANC , ANC , the old man shot his fists into the air .	39 6 1 12 6 1 11 1 2 78 2 6 0 1 11 6 1 38 6 1 10
I 'm inspired by the mood of the people .	23 14 40 38 6 1 12 6 1 10
Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in Lusaka , Zambia .	59 6 1 12 6 1 2 6 1 11 6 0 1 2 13 6 1 48 35 7 1 2 1 10
But the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing .	76 6 0 1 12 6 0 1 2 33 16 11 6 0 13 0 1 12 6 1 2 11 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 13 6 1 12 6 0 1 10
The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , said Cassim Saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu .	6 1 4 35 178 6 1 53 7 6 1 35 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 12 1 18 19 0 1 10
Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now .	1 20 60 67 728 198 6 1 18 19 23 35 10
There 's no turning back .	50 51 6 120 35 10
There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night , when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years .	50 51 35 23 146 6 1 12 0 1 0 1 2 75 1 12 1 162 38 6 0 0 0 1 12 1 12 1297 11 6 0 0 1 12 6 1 12 0 1 10
Deafening chants of ANC and Umkhonto we Sizwe shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle .	0 1 12 1 13 0 0 1 11 6 1 30 6 0 0 1 65 66 6 1 4 19 6 1 12 6 1 13 6 1 12 0 1 12 6 1 2 12 6 0 1 10
And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison .	76 23 64 38 6 1 18 19 0 1 2 6 1 42 0 1 2 33 14 40 38 23 13 48 7 1 10
Without him , said Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others is only a half-measure .	59 23 2 56 0 1 2 6 1 12 6 1 11 52 6 1 10
President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government .	0 0 0 1 73 6 0 1 106 67 38 1 12 6 0 1 12 6 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 106 7 1 12 6 1 18 19 6 1 12 1 13 1 12 124 6 1 4 19 1 12 0 1 12 6 0 1 40 57 146 1 6 1 12 0 1 10
But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .	76 1 4 35 168 32 6 1 12 0 1 13 1 12 6 36 0 1 10
As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control .	39 0 0 1 2 52 1 13 6 0 1 2 20 35 60 2 0 1 18 19 35 1 4 19 6 1 12 0 1 33 28 43 2 13 261 43 2 18 79 10
As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency .	39 6 1 34 35 2 6 36 0 1 4 115 29 29 29 43 18 19 6 0 1 12 0 1 102 102 13 6 0 1 12 6 1 13 1 12 6 1 12 1 10
If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest .	39 23 4 35 79 38 6 1 2 13 16 168 45 35 7 6 1 2 6 1 13 1 40 38 1 42 1 4 87 7 1 13 1 10
If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .	39 23 34 2 6 0 1 12 0 1 2 33 11 6 1 12 6 0 1 2 4 19 35 52 1 13 1 18 19 1 38 6 0 1 10
The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure .	6 36 0 0 1 16 4 87 7 0 1 10
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars .	6 1 37 113 35 18 79 30 6 1 12 6 1 48 7 0 0 1 13 1 91 39 23 34 2 1 4 5 23 7 6 1 18 5 0 1 7 1 10
Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government .	1 20 35 318 55 23 14 35 22 7 0 1 38 6 0 1 106 443 1 13 1 18 19 6 1 10
In addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment .	59 1 2 6 1 37 207 66 6 1 4 19 6 1 12 6 0 13 0 1 12 6 1 13 12 6 36 0 1 13 6 1 33 20 169 7 1 38 6 1 38 6 1 10
In order to head off any divisions , Mr. Mandela , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible .	1030 1 18 19 35 6 1 2 0 1 2 85 6 1 12 6 1 75 23 14 40 2 82 23 18 87 7 6 0 1 12 1 67 70 46 24 10
The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths , the so-called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action .	6 1 16 4 74 22 155 32 6 0 1 12 23 13 6 1 42 0 0 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 33 28 43 18 5 6 0 1 7 1 10
Says Peter Mokaba , president of the South African Youth Congress : We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC .	271 0 1 2 1 12 6 36 0 0 1 106 23 4 168 229 23 18 79 38 1 12 6 1 10
They never considered themselves to be anything else .	23 16 82 23 18 19 23 78 10
At last night 's rally , they called on their followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid .	59 0 1 42 1 2 23 64 38 6 1 18 115 29 2 29 24 2 84 6 1 12 1 10
We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , said Andrew Mlangeni , another early Umkhonto leader who is now 63 .	23 11 1 30 23 65 66 6 1 28 29 2 29 24 2 56 0 1 2 6 0 0 1 33 11 35 1 10
We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us .	23 64 18 178 0 1 13 52 6 1 53 7 1 2 13 39 23 14 35 40 23 4 35 178 23 53 7 23 10
